## About all subdirectories
This repository contains two python scripts and a schedule template file.

in <code>builder.py</code> and will be used to initiate the command to create 
actual schedules.

* <code>builder.py</code>: this python script contains all necessary components
to visualize schedules. 

* <code>template.xlsx</code>: this is the template file for all schedules that 
users would obtain after running our algorithm.
