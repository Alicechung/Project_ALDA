This course examines such arguments in relation to the pervasive evidence that magicality persists around precisely those sites most intimately associated with modernity's rationality and progress: the market, science and technology, and the state. Readings will be from anthropology, history, religious studies, and social theory."|Alireza Doostdar|[42576]|1|Graduate|SEM

Key themes include: environmental determinism, human and non-human interactions, interpretive approaches to space and place, the role of science in archaeological and historical practice, and the compartmentalization of “environment” and “landscape” as analytic focus. These themes loom large now - during what might be called the “environmental turn” of the controversial Anthropocene in the humanities and social sciences - and their intensifying resonance provides the basis for critical reflection of the discipline’s past and future trends.|Catherine Kearns|[43834]|1|Graduate|LEC
ANCM44916|Wed : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|The Discovery of Paganism|[]|Regenstein Library 207|Open|"How do we know what we know about ancient religions? Historians of religion often begin by turning to texts: either sacred texts, or, in the absence of such scriptures, descriptions of belief and practice by observers from outside the faith. Archaeologists focus their attention on the spaces and traces of religious practice—or at least those that survive—while art historians begin by examining images of deities and religious rites. Yet we often fail to see the extent to which the questions which we ask of all of these diverse sources are conditioned by Christian rhetoric about pagan worship. In this course, we compare two moments when Christians encountered ""pagans"": during the initial Christian construction of a discourse on paganism (and, more broadly, a discourse on religion) during the late Roman empire and during the Spanish discovery of the New World. Our course examines silences and absences in the textual and material records, as well as the divergences between texts and objects, in order to further our understanding of ancient religious practice. We will begin to see the many ways in which, as scholars of religion, we are in effect still Christian theologians, paving the way for new approaches to the study of ancient religion."|Clifford Ando, Claudia Brittenham|[43840]|1|Graduate|SEM

ANTH20702|Mon Wed : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM|Intro To African Civ-2|[]|Rosenwald Hall 329|Open|The second segment of the African Civilizations sequence uses anthropological perspectives to investigate colonial and postcolonial encounters in West and East Africa. The course objective is to show that while colonialism was brutal and oppressive, it was by no means a unidirectional process of domination in which Europeans plundered the African continent and enforced a wholesale adoption of European culture. Rather, scholars today recognize that colonial encounters were complex culture, political, and economic fields of interaction. Africans actively adopted, reworked, and contested colonizers' policies and projects, and Europeans drew heavily from these encounters to form liberal conceptions of self, nation, and society. Over the course of the quarter, students will learn about forms of personhood, political economy, and everyday life in the twentieth century. Course themes will include social reproduction, kinship practices, medicine, domesticity, and development. Note(s): Taking these courses in sequence is recommended but not required; this sequence meets the general education requirement in civilization studies. CHDV Distribution C*.

Despite the impact of literacy on modern minds this course argues for the persistence of ancient themes, plots, characters and motifs. A further argument is made for the foundational role of storytelling in the creation of culture and construction of society. The central place of storytelling is shown in the humanistic and social sciences: anthropology, economics, history, philosophy, politics, psychoanalysis. Student storytelling and performance of brief stories is encouraged and discussed in light of the main arguments of the course. J.Fernandez|James W Fernandez|[54785]|1|Undergraduate|SEM
ANTH21333|Tue Thu : 12:00 PM-01:20 PM|The Lived Body: Anthropology, Materiality & Meaningful Practice|[]|Haskell Hall 315|Open|"The body is implicated in all facets of human life. It is at once constraint and enabler, relational and personal, “real” and “imagined.” It is both individually performed and socially determined, the site of both domination and resistance. Anthropological theory has moved far from “Cartesian dualism” in which mind and body can and must be separate; this course will travel through ways of understanding bodies that have supplemented or bypassed this idea, or have existed outside of it entirely. We will consider what it means to have a body, to know a body, to be defined by a body – in short, to live a body. This class’s topical readings are oriented around the idea that “embodiment” involves both material entities and socially embedded processes. We will consider experience, consciousness, sensation, perception, and affect; we will interrogate processes, functions, and ways of knowing that are often taken for granted; we will prise apart the ways power is inscribed on and with bodies, both internally and externally. To do so, we will balance theory and ethnography in both our consumption and production of scholarly material., including a final ""auto-ethnography"" in which students adopt a new body practice for the quarter."|Andrea Ford|[43391]|1|Undergraduate|SEM

ANTH23091|Tue Thu : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM|Progress and Development in Latin America|[]|Psychology K114|Open|“Progress,” and its derived concept of “development” have puzzled Latin Americans throughout their modern history: they were an ambitious goal and a challenge for intellectual and political elites, a reality and an elusive dream for ordinary Latin Americans, and the cause of new challenges and problems wherever they actually or presumably took place. For historians, progress and development used to represent the very sense of universal history, a narrative that sneaked into visions of “Western modernity” and “globalization.” But later on, they became a myth to debunk rather than an object of reflection. What has “progress” meant particularly for Latin Americans? What is, for instance, the meaning of “progress” in the Brazilian flag? How did those notions shape the one of “development” since WWII? In political terms, what ideas of “progress” and “development” animated oligarchic, liberal, populist, military, revolutionary, and democratic projects across the region? Because both concepts involve planning and envisioning the outcome of present actions, the history of progress and development is also, in a certain way, a history of the future. The goal of this seminar is to help students situate a problem of their choice and trace its history in terms of the political debates that pursued the goal of progress and development in that specific realm.|Pablo Palomino|[41612]|1|Undergraduate|LEC

This course explores the emergence of the 'Middle East' as an object of inquiry; a place with a people and a culture set in opposition to the 'West'. It asks how these categories are constituted, by whom, and with what consequence. How do they define the contours of political community, the possibilities for empathy and understanding or the limits of rights and moral obligation? The historical and contemporary texts assigned draw attention to the layered and shifting meanings of these categories, and in turn to the geopolitical and epistomological worlds that give rise to them. By putting these texts into conversation with each other the course engages a number of key issues that have occupied social theorists: the relationship between power and knowledge, the politics of representation, and the nature of social theory more generally.|Yaqub Hilal|[54395]|1|Undergraduate|SEM

Students will examine the theoretical and methodological groundings of cultural psychiatry, examining how scholars working in the phenomenological tradition have tried to describe the lived experiences of various forms of “psychopathology” or “madness.” By the end of the course, students will have learned how to describe and analyze the social dimension of a mental health experience, using a phenomenologically-grounded anthropological approach, and by adopting a technical vocabulary for understanding the lived experiences of mental illness (for instance, phenomena, life-world, being-in-the-world, intentionality, epoché, embodiment, madness, psychopathology, melancholia/depression, schizophrenia, etc). In addition, given the ongoing problematic of “how to represent mental illness,” students will also have the opportunity to think through the different ways of presenting their analysis, both in the form of weekly blog entries and during a final-week mock-workshop, where they will showcase their work in a creative medium appropriate to that analysis.|Francis McKay|[54360]|1|Undergraduate|SEM

What social variables influence and shape 'real' markets and market activities? 'If you are so smart, why aren't you rich?' is a question economists have been asked in the past. Why isn't it easy to make money in financial areas even if one knows what economists know about markets, finance and the economy? And why, on the hand, is it so easy to get rich for some participants? Perhaps the answer is the real markets are complex social and cultural institutions which are quite different form organizations, administrations and the production side of the economy. The course provides an overview over social and cultural variables and patterns that play a role in economic behavior and specifically in financial markets.

We will examine the archaeological and textual evidence and methods used to reconstruct the components of the economies of Mesopotamian states in the third and second millennia. The course has five main sections: 1) Theoretical perspectives - general principles in economic anthropology as they apply to ancient economies, 2) Production – examining agriculture, herding, and craft production, 3) exchange and circulation, 4) goods and consumption, and 5) institutions. The course will focus on Near Eastern data placed in a comparative framework with case studies from other complex societies. The final class session will integrate archaeological and textual evidence for the different components of an ancient Near Eastern state economy by examining as a case study the 3rd millennium BC economy of Ebla in north Syria.

ANTH34201|Tue Thu : 10:30 AM-11:50 AM|Develop Social Cultural Thry-1|[]|Wilder House 101|Open|Systems II examines the development of key concepts in anthropology since the discipline’s institutionalization in the early 20th century. The course takes a genealogical approach to “anthropological theory” by tracking the formation, uptake and entailment's of different problem-spaces in anthropology—that is, the distinct complex of questions-and-answers around key themes and problems, which animate the discipline’s various modes of knowledge production. The course takes seriously the interplay of ethnographic inquiry and theory building and of professional practice and public engagement in the development of anthropology as a modern (and postmodern) discipline. While many of the concepts explored here will be recognizable as part of the “bread and butter” of anthropological research, the course is less interested in providing a comprehensive survey of 20th century anthropology than in interrogating the discipline’s signature style of theory building through ethnographic engagements in “the field.” We start from the premise that anthropological theory is a dialectical practice through which realist arguments about the historical world(s)—and the human’s place in it—are honed through empirical encounters and pushback from anthropology’s ethnographic subjects. Ultimately, the course hopes to track how anthropological ways of knowing intervene in the world through the making and stabilizing of particular lived concepts; that is, we ask after theory’s historical formation and durable effects, its social life, as well as afterlives, in the discipline and beyond.|Julie Chu|[43427]|1|Graduate|SEM

Students will examine the theoretical and methodological groundings of cultural psychiatry, examining how scholars working in the phenomenological tradition have tried to describe the lived experiences of various forms of “psychopathology” or “madness.” By the end of the course, students will have learned how to describe and analyze the social dimension of a mental health experience, using a phenomenologically-grounded anthropological approach, and by adopting a technical vocabulary for understanding the lived experiences of mental illness (for instance, phenomena, life-world, being-in-the-world, intentionality, epoché, embodiment, madness, psychopathology, melancholia/depression, schizophrenia, etc). In addition, given the ongoing problematic of “how to represent mental illness,” students will also have the opportunity to think through the different ways of presenting their analysis, both in the form of weekly blog entries and during a final-week mock-workshop, where they will showcase their work in a creative medium appropriate to that analysis.|Francis McKay|[54361]|1|Graduate|SEM

What social variables influence and shape 'real' markets and market activities? 'If you are so smart, why aren't you rich?' is a question economists have been asked in the past. Why isn't it easy to make money in financial areas even if one knows what economists know about markets, finance and the economy? And why, on the hand, is it so easy to get rich for some participants? Perhaps the answer is the real markets are complex social and cultural institutions which are quite different form organizations, administrations and the production side of the economy. The course provides an overview over social and cultural variables and patterns that play a role in economic behavior and specifically in financial markets. The readings examine the historical and structural embeddedness of economic action and institutions, the different constructions and interpretations of money, prices, and other dimensions of a market economy, and how a financial economy affects organizations, the art and other areas.|Karin Knorr Cetina|[54366]|1|Graduate|SEM

ANTH40350|Wed : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|Assembling the Biosocial|[]|TBA|Closed|Over recent decades research in the life sciences has increasingly drawn attention to the ways in which processes taking place outside “the body proper” profoundly shape the materializations of health and illness. Rather than understanding brains or genes as determinative and relatively immutable templates for human bodies and behaviors, researchers working on neuroplasticity and epigenetics have increasingly focused on understanding how social and material environments and experiences “get under the skin.” While many social scientists have welcomed these developments as validating long-held views about the social determination of health and illness, others have warned these seemingly paradigmatic shifts may only lead to new forms of reductionism. Perhaps most fundamentally, such emergent research has been described as the grounds for a renewed biosocial research agenda or for the rethinking of interdisciplinary work between the life and social sciences. This course traces both the discussions and their historical background, addressing topics including: the nature/culture distinction in anthropology, conceptualizations of “plasticity,” “development,” and “heredity” in the life and social sciences, and the forms of interdisciplinary exchange and conversation which biosocial research may require.|Eugene Raikhel|[43241]|1|Graduate|SEM

This course examines such arguments in relation to the pervasive evidence that magicality persists around precisely those sites most intimately associated with modernity's rationality and progress: the market, science and technology, and the state.

This seminar examines some of the major theoretical literature that notions of authenticity have generated and examines the use of authenticity in a variety of empirical domains in an effort to trace the historical origins of the concept, its multiple meanings in different contexts, the roles it has played in the creation of social boundaries, communities, and networks, and its relationship to the production of value in consumption and commodity marketing.

ANTH58205|Thu : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|Materiality|[]|TBA|Closed|Materiality is on everyone’s lips these days. Literatures across the disciplines are full of living bodies and concrete experiences, object biographies, ‘theories of things,’ a return to ‘matter,’ ‘new’ materialisms spun out of ‘old’ ones… While generative, materiality’s ubiquity also betrays a gap, an ambiguity, an absence. For what materiality is exactly remains unsure. Some seem to use it as a descriptive shorthand for the material world. Others as an analytic tending to the materialness of existence. Or as a discourse on it. For others still, it denotes the tangible effects of actions, practice, signs, and thought. Or a framework for unpacking the relationships mediating between people and things… Conjurations abound, yet seldom escape a certain circularity (“materiality studies… materiality?”). The concept has been used to frame a near infinite horizon of topics, from artefacts, of course, to cosmology, faith, finance, and absence, encompassing phenomena both enduring and ephemeral, both there and not-there. In taking on so much, has materiality outlasted its usefulness? What analytic work did it perform in the first place? With these considerations as background, through classic and recent literatures, this seminar will examine the relevance of ‘materiality’ (epistemologically, conceptually, methodologically) to anthropologies of the contemporary world, at a time when the ontologies of old are dissolving into a bubbling landscape of mixtures, hybridities, and post-humanities, which forces us to rethink basic questions of identity, agency, ethics and politics.|Francois Richard|[43532]|1|Graduate|SEM

Participants will see the Greeks emerge from poverty and anarchy to form a distinctive political and social system based on city-states—and they will see that system grow unstable and collapse. They will see the emergence of distinctive forms of sculpture, architecture, pottery, and urban design—many of which are still in use today. Along with these facts, they will acquire a conceptual toolkit for looking at works of art and for thinking about the relation of art to social life. The big question is: How can we make sense of the past by means of artifacts? Prerequisite(s): Students must attend first class to confirm enrollment. This course meets the general education requirement in the dramatic, musical, and visual arts.|Richard Neer|[43849]|1|Undergraduate|LEC

Yet how is such collaboration possible at all? Do language and pictures contribute differently to our cognition? Do they occupy incompatible temporalities? Do history, culture, and geography play major roles in how they interact? We will seek answers to these questions both in the classroom and in the presence of real artworks, in the Smart Museum and beyond.|Andrei Pop|[43857]|1|Undergraduate|LEC

Through the study of key artists, movements, and works of art, we will attend to a set of central problems: the formation of collective identities in these new nations, the impact of revolution, dictatorship, and political violence on the development of art in the region, the incorporation of both foreign styles and indigenous traditions, and the shifting definitions of Latin American art. Special emphasis will be placed on developing the skills needed to analyze a wide variety of modern and contemporary art, including painting, sculpture, photography, performance art, and site-specific installations.|Megan Sullivan|[53281]|1|Undergraduate|LEC

Beginning in the late eighteenth century with the flowering of revivalist and individualist trends and the explosion of creativity in the woodblock prints of Hokusai and others, we will then turn to examine Western-style architecture and painting in the late nineteenth century; socialism, art criticism, and the emergence of the avant garde in the early twentieth century.

ARTH17000|Wed Fri : 03:00 PM-04:20 PM|Introduction to Architecture|[]|Cochrane-Woods Art Ctr 152|Open|This course aims to equip students with the basic skills and knowledge required to analyze architecture and the urban environment. It offers an introduction to the methods and procedures of the architectural historian. These include practical tasks such as understanding architectural terminology, reading and interpreting architectural drawings, engaging with buildings ‘on site’, and studying buildings in context through urban design issues, such as street networks and public spaces. At a broader level, the course will involve critical discussions about the relationship between architecture and society, the building as a historical object, cultural representations of architecture, and modes of perceiving/experiencing the built environment. The course will operate through a combination of in-class seminars and site visits to buildings in Chicago. NOTE: On Fridays the class will often meet off-campus at sites throughout the city. Students will need to be able to get to these sites in plenty of time, and therefore should not have other classes directly before or after.|Amy Thomas|[53359]|2|Undergraduate|SEM

By focusing on these urban gathering sites, this course explores a range of key historical moments in which different formations of the city square emerge (political, communal, royal, imperial, colonial, modernist, privatized, etc.) Its goal is to define a set of criteria for analyzing what constitutes a city square, how “public space” also has a history, how public monuments function over time, and how understanding the urban environment is always dependent on the intimate relationship between physical structures and spatial performances. It will consider, therefore, both the design morphology and the social configurations that infuse such spaces with meaning in any given context.|Niall Atkinson|[53360]|1|Undergraduate|SEM

This course will introduce students to the history of the art of the book in the medieval West, exploring what kinds of books were made by medieval scribes and artists, how they were made, and what they meant to the men and women who gazed at their pages. We will meet in the Special Collections Research Center of the Regenstein Library, allowing us to explore the history of medieval book arts through close examinations of original medieval books and rare facsimiles. A wide range of illuminated books will be discussed—from those used in church rituals to those made for private aristocratic amusement.|Aden Kumler|[53362]|1|Undergraduate|SEM

Topics to be considered include the meaning of stylistic innovation in the 19th century, the development and dissolution of the genres as landscape and portraiture, and varying conceptions of realism and abstraction. Most class sessions will be devoted to looking at works in the galleries of the Art Institute. Because attendance is mandatory, students should consider whether their schedules will allow time for traveling to and from the museum for class meetings.

Through the study of both works of art and the writings of artists and critics, we will investigate new definitions of the art object, revolts against existing institutions of art, and the emergence of performance, media, and conceptual art. These developments will be read against social and political changes in the region, including the impasse of mid-century modernization efforts and the rise of repressive dictatorships. We will make extensive use of the Hélio Oiticica exhibition and related programming at the Art Institute during the quarter.|Megan Sullivan|[53366]|1|Undergraduate|SEM
ARTH23003|Tue Thu : 10:30 AM-11:50 AM|The Past Resurgent in Nineteenth-Century Art|[]|Cochrane-Woods Art Ctr 152|Open|This course will interrogate the various senses of the past that emerge from European (particularly French) art of the nineteenth century, which has been called the great age of historical revivalism. No doubt the turbulence of contemporary events—replete with revolutions as well as rapid social and technological change—had something to do with the unprecedented ways in which nineteenth-century artists regarded and represented history, with a protean embrace of past styles. Themes and topics to be considered include Homer and the classical past; Joan of Arc and medieval revivalism; Napoleon; modern life and the uses of history; monuments; and primitivism. Engaging closely with the Classicisms exhibition on view at the Smart Museum in winter/spring 2017, the course will also examine objects from the Smart’s permanent collection and draw upon a series of critical and theoretical readings. Interested students will have the option to help organize a small, collection-based response exhibition.|Anne Leonard|[53370]|1|Undergraduate|SEM
ARTH23802|Thu : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|COSI: How Photographs Look|[]|Cochrane-Woods Art Ctr 153|Open|The processes, techniques, and formats for making and presenting photographs have evolved continuously since photography’s public debut in 1839. This course provides an introduction to the dynamic appearances of photographs through history. Rather than focusing on questions of style and subject matter, we will explore the visual “syntax” of photographic prints, exploring how the material aspects of their making can shape, alter, or determine meaning. Using materials from the Art Institute of Chicago’s Photography Collection, we will learn how to identify various kinds of photographic objects based on their visual and material attributes, building on that knowledge as a basis for art historical analysis, connoisseurship, and conservation. The course will follow a loose chronological structure, starting with early daguerreotypes and salted paper prints and ending with contemporary color and digital techniques. Along the way, we will consider: what makes photography a unified “medium”? How do the technical and aesthetic traditions of photography interact with one another? What makes some processes better suited to certain purposes than others? What variables do photographers consider while choosing a process or format? How have the changing material and visual qualities of photographs influenced ideas about photography in a general sense?|Carl Fuldner|[54504]|1|Undergraduate|SEM
ARTH24002|Wed : 10:30 AM-01:20 PM|Advanced Nonfiction Workshop: Writing About the Arts|[]|Cochrane-Woods Art Ctr 153|Open|Writing about the arts has long been a way for writers to investigate the wide world, and to look inward. In this course, we’ll be focusing on the visual arts, and we’ll try to see how reflecting on painting, photography, installation art, and those arts that get called “decorative” gives us ways to consider the object in space, and also history, war, friendship, education, material culture, aesthetics, and coming-of-age. In writing, we will practice all kinds of forms: lyric fragments; polemics; reviews; catalog essays; museum wall texts; personal meditations on a single work; documentation of lost techniques and lost works; and history, criticism, and biography written for readers outside the academy. Students will also write a longer essay to be workshopped in class. We’ll read and discuss writers such as Susan Sontag, Geoff Dyer, Claudia Rankine, Tiana Bighorse, Rebecca Solnit, Zbigniew Herbert, Donald Judd, Octavio Paz, Mark Doty, Hervé Guibert, Kevin Young, Lawrence Weschler, and Walter Benjamin.

It is not designed to be a survey course, but rather a historical investigation of certain issues and developments. We will concentrate on the following: what has been said to happen to objects when they are uprooted and moved into the museum; how and why museums have changed display practices so as to get viewers to look at art in new ways; what artists have understood museums to represent and how they have responded to that understanding in their work and their display preferences. Though reference will be made to the contemporary art world, the focus will be on materials and case studies drawn from the French Revolution through the 1960s. French, German, English, and American museums will be featured.|Martha Ward|[54507]|1|Undergraduate|SEM

But it is as much a dogged search for objective grounds of expression and intelligibility amidst a sea of subjectivity: from Van Gogh's letters and Mallarme's poems to the new logical symbolism of Frege and the stream of consciousness of William James, the epoch saw an unprecedented effort to rationalize the private, the incommunicable, experience itself.

Through lecture, screening and group discussions, we will trace the historical relationship between visual culture and the social sciences, uncovering how this has impacted ways of viewing objects, people and cultures within the Western tradition. Armed with this knowledge, we will consider how the ethnographer’s commitment to the study of Others has been challenged by an increasingly globalised and post-colonial world. We will explore questions of authority and subjectivity in ethnographic fieldwork. Finally, we will look to contemporary artworks and exhibitions that have reinvested in the image and practice of the ethnographer to uncover the politics and poetics of their work. You will be introduced to the practices of Brad Butler and Karen Mirza, Paulo Nazareth, Marine Hugonnier, Camille Henrot, Kapwani Kiwanga et. al. Sessions will include close reading and discussion of texts by Hal Foster, James Clifford, Clementine Deliss, Okwui Enwezor and Kaelen Wilson-Goldie, amongst others.

ARTH40010|Tue Thu : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|Ruins|[]|Regenstein Library 207|Open|“Ruins” will cover texts and images, from Thucydides to WWII, via the Reformation. We will include films (e.g. Rossellini’s “Germany Year Zero”), art (e.g. H. Robert, Piranesi) archaeology, and the museum (Soane). On ruins writing, we will read Thucydides, Pausanias from within antiquity, the Enlightenment responses to the destruction and archaeological rediscovery of Pompeii, Diderot, Simmel, Freud on the mind as levels of ruins (Rome) and the analysis as reconstructive archaeologist as well as on the novel Gradiva and the Acropolis, the Romantic obsession with ruins, and the firebombing in WWII. We will also consider the photographing of ruins, and passages from the best-known works on photography (Benjamin, Sontag, Ritchen, Fried, Azoulay). The goal is to see how ruin gazing, and its depictions (textual, imagistic, photographic, etc.) change from the ancients (Greek and Roman), to the Romantic use of ruins as a source of (pleasurable) melancholy, to the technological “advances” in targeting and decimating civilian populations that describe the Second Word War.|Jas Elsner, Francoise Meltzer|[43836]|1|Graduate|SEM
ARTH40310|Wed : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|The Discovery of Paganism|[]|Regenstein Library 207|Open|"How do we know what we know about ancient religions? Historians of religion often begin by turning to texts: either sacred texts, or, in the absence of such scriptures, descriptions of belief and practice by observers from outside the faith. Archaeologists focus their attention on the spaces and traces of religious practice—or at least those that survive—while art historians begin by examining images of deities and religious rites. Yet we often fail to see the extent to which the questions which we ask of all of these diverse sources are conditioned by Christian rhetoric about pagan worship. In this course, we compare two moments when Christians encountered ""pagans"": during the initial Christian construction of a discourse on paganism (and, more broadly, a discourse on religion) during the late Roman empire and during the Spanish discovery of the New World. Our course examines silences and absences in the textual and material records, as well as the divergences between texts and objects, in order to further our understanding of ancient religious practice. We will begin to see the many ways in which, as scholars of religion, we are in effect still Christian theologians, paving the way for new approaches to the study of ancient religion."|Clifford Ando, Claudia Brittenham|[43841]|1|Graduate|SEM
ARTH41610|Mon : 06:00 PM-08:50 PM|Between East and West: Venice in the Pre-Modern Period|[]|Swift Hall 201|Open|Venice’s long-standing ties with the Byzantine Empire have left their visible trace in the city’s art and architecture and have had an equally strong impact on Venetian myth-making in the pre-modern period. Until today the appropriation of Byzantine style is especially evident in the church of Saint Mark the Evangelist, as well as in the decoration of less-well known medieval churches of the Venetian Lagoon. During the so-called Fourth Crusade, the Sack of Constantinople has led to large-scale pillaging of the Byzantine capital and the transfer to Venice of countless Byzantine artifacts, among them are liturgical items, reliquaries, icons, and architectural spoils. How were these artifacts employed in the Venetian Lagoon for religious and political ends after being disassociated from their original contexts? What transformations did they experience with regard to usage and appearance? What kinds of new ceremonies, both religious and secular, did they inspire? What was their impact on artistic creativity and religious life in their new environment? How were they perceived intellectually, and what kinds of narratives evolved around them in Venice over the centuries? These are some of the key questions to guide our research. On a broader scale, we will investigate various phenomena of cultural transfer and ‘hybridity’ from the Middle Ages to the Baroque era.|Karin Krause|[41404]|1|Graduate|SEM
ARTH42250|Thu : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|Materiality & Medieval Art History|[]|Campus North Res Commons 158|Open|"In recent years the role played by materials and concepts (both implicit and explicit) of materiality in relation to European medieval culture have preoccupied medievalists working in a wide range of disciplines: this seminar aims to critically confront this scholarly work with a range of medieval objects and practices. Questions of how materials might ""mean"" in the Middle Ages, as well as how works of art and material culture were informed by and also contributed to medieval understandings of ""materia,"" materiality, and processes of material making will be central to the seminar's work. The seminar will critically consider not only the varied scholarly perspectives often dubbed ""the new materialism,"" and we will also return to several important ""old"" materialisms that might yet have insights to offer the study of medieval material and intellectual culture. Readings will be drawn not only from the discipline of art history but also from the history of ideas, of science, medieval literature, law, theology, etc. In addition to collective discussion of medieval artifacts and works of art, we will also confront a range of medieval texts."|Aden Kumler|[54585]|1|Graduate|SEM

ARTH48201|Tue : 03:00 PM-05:50 PM|Florentine Topographies: Art, Architecture, and Urban Life|[]|Campus North Res Commons 158|Open|The site of some of the most widely recognizable monuments of western art history and the home to some of the most famous artists, writers, designers, thinkers, and cultural patrons of early modern culture, Florence has long occupied a central place in a larger pan-European discourse of Modernity, Beauty, and the Individual Subject. As a result, the city itself has come to occupy a mythic position as a central hub of Western intellectual culture: uprooted from its geographical specificity by the circulation of such proper names as Machiavelli, Leonardo, Michelangelo, and unmoored from its historical heritage by the disorienting complexities of modern mass tourism. Therefore, this course seeks to re-integrate the “Renaissance” into the urban context from which it emerged, to defamiliarize it so that it can be looked at from other perspectives. It focuses on the city itself as the protagonist of some of the most important experiments in art, architecture, and urban development and shows how they were intimately connected to a lively and engaged social body. By approaching images and monuments through the spatial practices by which they were encountered by Renaissance society (rituals of conflict, contests, economic exchange, religious devotion, urban politics, identity formation, among others), students will gain a more nuanced understanding of the links between a localized urban culture and a larger intercultural and cross-temporal exchange of ideas.|Niall Atkinson|[54588]|1|Graduate|SEM

We are now able to place our Solar System into the context of other worlds and a surprising conclusion that most planetary systems look nothing like our own. A challenging next step is to find planets as small as the Earth in orbit around stars like the Sun. The architecture of planetary systems reflects the formation of the parent star and its protoplanetary disk, and how these have changed with time. This course will review the techniques for discovery of planets around other stars, what we have learned so far about exoplanetary systems, and the driving questions for the future, including the quest for habitable environments elsewhere.

Advances in genetic knowledge gained through sequencing have been applied to drug response, and identifying heritable genetic variants that predict response and toxicity is an area of great interest to researchers. The ultimate goal is to identify clinically significant variations to predict the right choice and dose of medications for individuals—""personalizing medicine."" The study of pharmacogenomics is complicated by the fact that response and toxicity are multigenic traits and are often confounded by nongenetic factors (e.g., age, co-morbidities, drug-drug interactions, environment, diet). Using knowledge of an individual's DNA sequence as an integral determinant of drug therapy has not yet become standard clinical practice; however, several genetics-guided recommendations for physicians have been developed and are highlighted. The ethics and economics of pharmacogenomics are also discussed."|R. Stephanie Huang, Barbara Stranger|[43382]|1|Undergraduate|SEM

BPRO24000|Mon : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|Understanding Wisdom|[]|Psychology B101|Open|"Thinking about the nature of wisdom goes back to the Greek philosophers and the classical religious sages, but the concept of wisdom has changed in many ways over the history of thought. While wisdom has received less scholarly attention in modern times, it has recently re-emerged in popular discourse with a growing recognition of its potential importance for addressing complex issues in many domains. But what is wisdom? It’s often used with a meaning more akin to ""smart"" or ""clever."" Is it just vast knowledge? This course will examine the nature of wisdom—how it has been defined, how its meaning has changed, and what its essential components might be. We will examine how current psychological theories conceptualize wisdom and consider whether, and how, wisdom can be studied scientifically; that is, can wisdom be measured and experimentally manipulated to illuminate its underlying mechanisms and understand its functions? Finally, we will explore how concepts of wisdom can be applied in business, education, medicine, the law, and in the course of our everyday lives. Readings will be drawn from a wide array of disciplines including philosophy, classics, history, psychology, behavioral economics, medicine, and public policy."|W.

BPRO26750|Mon : 12:30 PM-03:20 PM|Anxiety|[]|TBA|Open|The phenomenon of anxiety emerged as one of the leading psychological disorders of the 20th and 21st centuries. Worrying ourselves into the realm of the pathological, we now have a requisite measure of anxiety for every prescribed stage of life. But why are we so anxious? Considering its prevalence in everyday life, the concept and theories of anxiety have been employed surprisingly seldom as a way into film, fiction, and art. In this course we examine the modern origin of contemporary discourses specific to anxiety and their unique manifestation in cultural artifacts. To understand the complex of anxiety in the so-called Western world, we rely on the theories of Søren Kierkegaard, Martin Heidegger, Sigmund Freud, Jacques Lacan, and Alenka Zupančič; fiction by Stoker, Schnitzler, Kafka, and Sebald; and film by Haneke, Kubrick, Ophuls, and Hitchcock. We will also have guest speakers from the fields of clinical psychiatry, geriatric medicine, philosophy, and comparative anthropology.|Anne Flannery, Malynne Sternstein|[41035]|1|Undergraduate|SEM

CATA22900|TBA|Catalan Avant-Garde Theater|[]|TBA|Open|Theater is the mirror of the nation. The clearest expression of its urges, of its battles, and, as Adorno would say, of its own contradictions. Catalunya is one of the most modern and European-like countries of the west. This desire for modernism is expressed in artists such as Salvador Dalí as well as the avant-garde daydreaming theater of La Fura dels Baus. In Catalunya, a small country, theater was the national defense during Franco’s dictatorship and in the present times serves as a nationalist weapon to claim independence. In this course, we will explore the history of Catalunya and Europe through theater, by means of written literature and footage of performances which will make lectures more dynamic and attractive. Also, we will meet the personal dramas of women and their social and historical implications through the theory of gender. Theater is a recreational and collective way of understanding a culture, thus it will be proposed to the students the possibility of creating a short play written and performed by them. Methodologically, the course is multifaceted and intertextual. The analysis tools are comparatist, historical, political, linguistic, psychiatric, and philosophical; the approach is creative (writing and acting) and related to cultural studies and feminism. The aim is to demonstrate that Catalan drama is a splendid window to get to know the Catalan culture and is fully integrated into contemporary theater.|Staff|[42033]|1|Undergraduate|LEC

How does clinical research differ from other research traditions? What is special about clinical research? What types of questions can be answered by clinical research (what questions not)? What types of ethical oversight over the responsible conduct of research have arisen over the years? We will learn how to read and critique clinical research, survey the major types of clinical research designs, and the differences between hypothesis generation and hypothesis testing. Finally, we provide an overview of the mechanics of developing and implementing clinical research, including grant writing, regulatory issues, and quality assurance. Along the way, we will be teaching core statistical concepts including prevalence, risk ratios, and sensitivity and validation techniques. The objectives are for students to obtain an understanding of how and why to perform clinical research and to do so in an ethical and responsible manner.|Valerie Press|[43376]|1|Pritzker School of Medicine|SEM

The course lectures and readings will provide a rigorous examination of the interactions among pathogens, hosts and the environment that produce disease in diverse populations. In addition to the demographic characteristics and the behaviors of individuals that are associated with a high risk of infection, we will examine complex aspects of the environment as they pertain to disease transmission. These include poverty, globalization, social networks, public health, and racial and ethnic disparities. Methodologic approaches to infectious disease epidemiology that will be covered include traditional study designs, molecular epidemiology, social network analysis, modeling, and network science. Local and global approaches will be applied to case studies from the United States, Asia and Africa.|Michael David|[40730]|1|Pritzker School of Medicine|LEC

CDIN40010|Tue Thu : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|Ruins|[]|Regenstein Library 207|Open|“Ruins” will cover texts and images, from Thucydides to WWII, via the Reformation. We will include films (e.g. Rossellini’s “Germany Year Zero”), art (e.g. H. Robert, Piranesi) archaeology, and the museum (Soane). On ruins writing, we will read Thucydides, Pausanias from within antiquity, the Enlightenment responses to the destruction and archaeological rediscovery of Pompeii, Diderot, Simmel, Freud on the mind as levels of ruins (Rome) and the analysis as reconstructive archaeologist as well as on the novel Gradiva and the Acropolis, the Romantic obsession with ruins, and the firebombing in WWII. We will also consider the photographing of ruins, and passages from the best-known works on photography (Benjamin, Sontag, Ritchen, Fried, Azoulay). The goal is to see how ruin gazing, and its depictions (textual, imagistic, photographic, etc.) change from the ancients (Greek and Roman), to the Romantic use of ruins as a source of (pleasurable) melancholy, to the technological “advances” in targeting and decimating civilian populations that describe the Second Word War.|Jas Elsner, Francoise Meltzer|[43835]|1|Graduate|SEM
CDIN40301|Wed : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|The Discovery of Paganism|[]|Regenstein Library 207|Open|"How do we know what we know about ancient religions? Historians of religion often begin by turning to texts: either sacred texts, or, in the absence of such scriptures, descriptions of belief and practice by observers from outside the faith. Archaeologists focus their attention on the spaces and traces of religious practice—or at least those that survive—while art historians begin by examining images of deities and religious rites. Yet we often fail to see the extent to which the questions which we ask of all of these diverse sources are conditioned by Christian rhetoric about pagan worship. In this course, we compare two moments when Christians encountered ""pagans"": during the initial Christian construction of a discourse on paganism (and, more broadly, a discourse on religion) during the late Roman empire and during the Spanish discovery of the New World. Our course examines silences and absences in the textual and material records, as well as the divergences between texts and objects, in order to further our understanding of ancient religious practice. We will begin to see the many ways in which, as scholars of religion, we are in effect still Christian theologians, paving the way for new approaches to the study of ancient religion."|Clifford Ando, Claudia Brittenham|[43839]|1|Graduate|SEM

We will specifically explore the question: What is social adulthood? In doing so, we will seek to understand how social adulthood fits into the life course. That is, how does it differ from adolescence or adulthood? Can it be considered a distinct developmental stage? In the first part of class, we will focus on life course stage theory to understand the analytic construction of life course stages. In the second part of the course, we will explore current literature on the stalled transition to social adulthood in different socio-cultural contexts and critically examine the following “new” stages: “emerging adulthood” in the US and “waithood” in the Middle East. In the third part of the class, we will turn to futurity in order to understand the link between social adulthood and projects of future making. Throughout the course, we will consider the impact of gender, socioeconomic status, race, religion, and generation. Some themes we will address include temporality, globalization, modernity, capitalism, and family crisis.|Lindsey Conklin|[43207]|1|Undergraduate|SEM

In this course, we leverage sociological and social scientific concepts, theories and methods to examine how these inequalities in morbidity, mortality, and health behaviors develop and change across the life course from infancy to later life. We will pay particular attention to how individual characteristics (namely gender, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and sexual orientation, but also genetic vulnerabilities) interact with social-structural, institutional, and cultural realities to shape individual’s physical and mental health. We will also discuss how social conditions, particularly during key developmental stages, can have lifelong consequences for individual’s health and well-being.|Anna Mueller|[43212]|1|Undergraduate|SEM
CHDV20773|Tue Thu : 03:00 PM-04:20 PM|Emotion in Social Sciences|[]|Rosenwald Hall 329|Open|This course provides a broad overview of theory and research on human emotions across different fields of social sciences. Each discipline highlights different aspects of human emotions: psychological studies tends to focus on individual experiences of emotion; sociological studies focus on emotion in social context; and anthropological studies focus on cultural constitution of emotions. As we critically examine psychological, sociological, and anthropological conceptions of emotion, we will aim to arrive at a comprehensive account of human emotions that neither sidelines the lived experience of emotions nor disregards their relationships to society and culture. Following a review of emotions across different disciplines in social sciences, we will visit the relationship between gender and emotion, development of emotions, and mental health and emotions. It is expected that you will develop a deeper understanding of human emotions.|Sevda Numanbayraktaroglu|[43256]|1|Undergraduate|SEM

CHDV21401|Mon Wed : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM|Intro To African Civ-2|[]|Rosenwald Hall 329|Open|The second segment of the African Civilizations sequence uses anthropological perspectives to investigate colonial and postcolonial encounters in West and East Africa. The course objective is to show that while colonialism was brutal and oppressive, it was by no means a unidirectional process of domination in which Europeans plundered the African continent and enforced a wholesale adoption of European culture. Rather, scholars today recognize that colonial encounters were complex culture, political, and economic fields of interaction. Africans actively adopted, reworked, and contested colonizers' policies and projects, and Europeans drew heavily from these encounters to form liberal conceptions of self, nation, and society. Over the course of the quarter, students will learn about forms of personhood, political economy, and everyday life in the twentieth century. Course themes will include social reproduction, kinship practices, medicine, domesticity, and development. Note(s): Taking these courses in sequence is recommended but not required; this sequence meets the general education requirement in civilization studies. CHDV Distribution C*.

Students will examine the theoretical and methodological groundings of cultural psychiatry, examining how scholars working in the phenomenological tradition have tried to describe the lived experiences of various forms of “psychopathology” or “madness.” By the end of the course, students will have learned how to describe and analyze the social dimension of a mental health experience, using a phenomenologically-grounded anthropological approach, and by adopting a technical vocabulary for understanding the lived experiences of mental illness (for instance, phenomena, life-world, being-in-the-world, intentionality, epoché, embodiment, madness, psychopathology, melancholia/depression, schizophrenia, etc). In addition, given the ongoing problematic of “how to represent mental illness,” students will also have the opportunity to think through the different ways of presenting their analysis, both in the form of weekly blog entries and during a final-week mock-workshop, where they will showcase their work in a creative medium appropriate to that analysis.|Francis McKay|[54362]|1|Graduate|SEM

CHDV40203|Mon Wed : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM|Youth of the Great Recession|[]|TBA|Closed|This research seminar is designed for graduate students who are eager to investigate how the Great Recession in the past decade has affected the life course trajectories of people, especially children and youth, in various demographic groups defined by the intersections of social class, race/ethnicity, gender, and urbanisity. Dramatic changes in the economic context have posed challenges to individuals, families, and communities to various degrees, which offer opportunities to revisit and possibly revise theories about human development. The class will raise big questions substantiated by the literature and will ask specific questions for empirical investigation. These questions will then evolve into research projects to be carried out collectively or individually through analyzing large-scale longitudinal data sets. The process will involve discussions of appropriate research designs, development of data analytic plans, and interpretations of empirical evidence. Throughout the course, students will receive hands-on training on how to write an empirical paper for an academic journal. Students are expected to produce single-authored or co-authored manuscripts at the end of the course.

We will supplement this discussion with an inquiry into the possibility and limits of self without an other, and visit the question of how human consciousness differs from that of other primates. In the course of our discussions, we will critically engage issues concerning the development of the self, its unity, individuality, and agency, and the possibilities of creativity, resistance and the transformation of the self.

CHDV43255|Wed : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|Assembling the Biosocial|[]|TBA|Closed|Over recent decades research in the life sciences has increasingly drawn attention to the ways in which processes taking place outside “the body proper” profoundly shape the materializations of health and illness. Rather than understanding brains or genes as determinative and relatively immutable templates for human bodies and behaviors, researchers working on neuroplasticity and epigenetics have increasingly focused on understanding how social and material environments and experiences “get under the skin.” While many social scientists have welcomed these developments as validating long-held views about the social determination of health and illness, others have warned these seemingly paradigmatic shifts may only lead to new forms of reductionism. Perhaps most fundamentally, such emergent research has been described as the grounds for a renewed biosocial research agenda or for the rethinking of interdisciplinary work between the life and social sciences. This course traces both the discussions and their historical background, addressing topics including: the nature/culture distinction in anthropology, conceptualizations of “plasticity,” “development,” and “heredity” in the life and social sciences, and the forms of interdisciplinary exchange and conversation which biosocial research may require.|Eugene Raikhel|[43240]|1|Graduate|SEM

This course will provide an introduction to sociological perspectives on gender, physical and mental health, and medicine while also providing a deep interrogation of the social, institutional, and biological links between gender and health. We will discuss inequalities in morbidity, mortality, and health behaviors of women, men, and transgendered individuals from different race, ethnic, and class backgrounds, and we will use sociological concepts, theories, and methods to understand why these differences appear. Finally, we will examine how medicine as an institution and medical practices as organizations sometimes contribute to and combat gender inequality in health. By the end of the course, you will be familiar with social scientific perspectives on (1) gender, (2) mental and physical health, and (3) the practice of medicine, as well as some of the fundamental debates in current medical sociology and sociology of gender.|Anna Mueller|[43242]|1|Graduate|SEM

The perceived fissure between the “Two Cultures” has been deepened by the fact that the bulk of all history and philosophy of science has been devoted to the natural sciences. This seminar addresses the history and epistemology of what in the nineteenth century came to be called the “sciences” and the “humanities” since the Renaissance from an integrated perspective. The historical sources will focus on shared practices in, among others, philology, natural history, astronomy, and history. The philosophical source will develop an epistemology of the humanities: how humanists know what they know.|Lorraine Daston|[55057]|1|Graduate|SEM
CHSS32800|Fri : 09:30 AM-12:20 PM|Experiencing Madness: Empathic Methods in Cultural Psychiatry|[]|Saieh Hall for Economics 247|Open|This course provides students with an introduction to the phenomenological approach in cultural psychiatry, focusing on the problem of “how to represent mental illness” as a thematic anchor. Students will examine the theoretical and methodological groundings of cultural psychiatry, examining how scholars working in the phenomenological tradition have tried to describe the lived experiences of various forms of “psychopathology” or “madness.” By the end of the course, students will have learned how to describe and analyze the social dimension of a mental health experience, using a phenomenologically-grounded anthropological approach, and by adopting a technical vocabulary for understanding the lived experiences of mental illness (for instance, phenomena, life-world, being-in-the-world, intentionality, epoché, embodiment, madness, psychopathology, melancholia/depression, schizophrenia, etc). In addition, given the ongoing problematic of “how to represent mental illness,” students will also have the opportunity to think through the different ways of presenting their analysis, both in the form of weekly blog entries and during a final-week mock-workshop, where they will showcase their work in a creative medium appropriate to that analysis.|Francis McKay|[53674]|1|Graduate|SEM

CHSS35506|Tue : 12:00 PM-02:50 PM|Science and Aesthetics in the 18th-21st Centuries|[]|TBA|Open|One can distinguish four ways in which science and aesthetics are related during the period since the Renaissance. First, science has been the subject of artistic representation, in painting and photography, in poetry and novels (e.g., in Byron’s poetry, for example). Second, science has been used to explain aesthetic effects (e.g., Helmholtz’s work on the way painters achieve visual effects or musicians achieve tonal effects). Third, aesthetic means have been used to convey scientific conceptions (e.g., through illustrations in scientific volumes or through aesthetically affective and effective writing). Finally, philosophers have stepped back to consider the relationship between scientific knowing and aesthetic comprehension (e.g., Kant, Bas van Fraassen); much of the discussion of this latter will focus on the relation between images and what they represent. In this lecture-discussion course we will consider all of these aspects of the science-aesthetic connection.|Robert Richards|[42919]|1|Graduate|SEM

CLAS44916|Wed : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|The Discovery of Paganism|[]|Regenstein Library 207|Open|"How do we know what we know about ancient religions? Historians of religion often begin by turning to texts: either sacred texts, or, in the absence of such scriptures, descriptions of belief and practice by observers from outside the faith. Archaeologists focus their attention on the spaces and traces of religious practice—or at least those that survive—while art historians begin by examining images of deities and religious rites. Yet we often fail to see the extent to which the questions which we ask of all of these diverse sources are conditioned by Christian rhetoric about pagan worship. In this course, we compare two moments when Christians encountered ""pagans"": during the initial Christian construction of a discourse on paganism (and, more broadly, a discourse on religion) during the late Roman empire and during the Spanish discovery of the New World. Our course examines silences and absences in the textual and material records, as well as the divergences between texts and objects, in order to further our understanding of ancient religious practice. We will begin to see the many ways in which, as scholars of religion, we are in effect still Christian theologians, paving the way for new approaches to the study of ancient religion."|Clifford Ando, Claudia Brittenham|[43842]|1|Graduate|SEM

CLCV21806|TBA|The New Latin American Cinema and Its Afterlife|[]|TBA|Closed|This course will introduce students to Latin American film studies through an assessment of its most critically celebrated period of radical filmmaking. The New Latin American Cinema (NLAC) of the late 1950s-70s generated unprecedented international enthusiasm for Latin American film production. The filmmakers of this loosely designated movement were defining themselves in relation to global realist film traditions like Italian Neorealism and Griersonian documentary, in relation to--mostly failed-- experiments in building Hollywood-style national film industries, and in relation to regional discourses of underdevelopment and mestizaje. Since the late 1990s, a reassessment of the legacy of the NLAC has been taking shape as scholars have begun to interrogate its canonical status in the face of a changed political climate. In the sphere of filmmaking, contemporary Latin American new wave cinemas are also grappling with that legacy-sometimes disavowing it, sometimes appropriating it. We will situate the NLAC in its historical context, survey its formal achievements and political aspirations, assess its legacy, and take stock of the ways and the reasons that it haunts contemporary production.|Staff|[53555]|1|Undergraduate|SEM

Participants will see the Greeks emerge from poverty and anarchy to form a distinctive political and social system based on city-states—and they will see that system grow unstable and collapse. They will see the emergence of distinctive forms of sculpture, architecture, pottery, and urban design—many of which are still in use today. Along with these facts, they will acquire a conceptual toolkit for looking at works of art and for thinking about the relation of art to social life.

In this course, we will explore the fall of the Roman republic from a number of different angles: as a crisis experienced and vividly described by Cicero and his contemporaries, as a societal watershed that captured the imaginations of Rome’s literary giants (including Virgil, Lucan, and Tacitus), and as the failure of a political system based upon the principle of popular sovereignty. Through the close reading of Latin literature and the analysis of secondary scholarship, we will try to determine the significance that the demise of the republic held for contemporary Romans, as well as the significance that it continues to hold today. In light of recent events at home and abroad, what makes a republic work—and what happens when it fails—is a topic that has never been more relevant|Julia Mebane|[43776]|1|Undergraduate|LEC

From the earliest shatranj puzzles of the sixth-century to the chess schools of the Soviet Union, societies across the world have turned to the game for intellectual challenge and to sharpen mental acuity. As the quintessential activity of human reasoning, chess soon became a favorite subject for cognitive science research, yielding insights into search methods, memory, judgment, and problem-solving strategies. In this course, we will read select chess narratives in tandem with supplementary readings on cognition to understand the role of game playing in cultural imagination beyond metaphor. These supplementary readings will explore evaluative judgments, memory processes, and human perception, among other topics. We will examine various works of troubled genius, beginning with Vladimir Nabokov’s 1930 tale of chess and obsession, The Defense. Stefan Zweig’s own contribution in his 1941 Chess Story will round out our exploration of monomania and the tenuous boundaries of reason. Other authors of interest include Edgar Allan Poe, Samuel Beckett, Viktor Shklovskii, Johan Huizinga, Michel Foucault, H.Simon & W.Chase, et al.|Monica Felix|[54851]|1|Undergraduate|SEM

CMLT23401|Mon Wed : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM|The Burden of History: The Nation and Its Lost Paradise|[]|Foster Hall 408|Open|How and why do national identities provoke the deep emotional attachments that they do? In this course we try to understand these emotional attachments by examining the narrative of loss and redemption through which most nations in the Balkans retell their Ottoman past. We begin by considering the mythic temporality of the Romantic national narrative while focusing on specific national literary texts where the national past is retold through the formula of original wholeness, foreign invasion, Passion, and Salvation. We then proceed to unpack the structural role of the different elements of that narrative. With the help of Žižek’s theory of the subject as constituted by trauma, we think about the national fixation on the trauma of loss, and the role of trauma in the formation of national consciousness. Specific theme inquiries involve the figure of the Janissary as self and other, brotherhood and fratricide, and the writing of the national trauma on the individual physical body. Special attention is given to the general aesthetic of victimhood, the casting of the victimized national self as the object of the “other’s perverse desire.” With the help of Freud, Žižek, and Kant we consider the transformation of national victimhood into the sublimity of the national self. The main primary texts include Petar Njegoš’ Mountain Wreath (Serbia and Montenegro), Ismail Kadare’s The Castle (Albania), Anton Donchev’s Time of Parting (Bulgaria).|Angelina Ilieva|[42374]|1|Undergraduate|LEC

CMLT25702|Tue Thu : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM|Memoir in Modernism|[]|Foster Hall 408|Open|This course serves as an introduction to Russian and European modernism, taking the fictionalized autobiography as its focus. In the early twentieth century the novel-memoir becomes arguably the foremost vehicle for literary modernism. We will examine the literary strategies used to represent the workings of memory and the construction of their autobiographical worlds. What role does tradition play in foregrounding the writers’ approach to their immediate familial and cultural past? How is the experience of time reconfigured by the processes of memory, and what rhetorical techniques are used to effect this in prose narratives? Readings may include James Joyce’s A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, Andrei Bely’s Kotik Letaev, Virginia Woolf’s To the Lighthouse, Osip Mandelshtam’s The Noise of Time and Vladimir Nabokov’s Speak, Memory, as well as selections from Boris Pasternak, Marcel Proust, Andrei Platonov, Marina Tsvetaeva and others. Supplementary readings will include texts by Sigmund Freud, Henri Bergson, Gérard Genette and Mikhail Bakhtin.

CMLT57100|Thu : 10:30 AM-01:20 PM|From Pentecost to Babel: Writing Between Languages|[]|TBA|Open|What happens to literary works whose authors think in more than one language, and allow that excess to be registered in their texts? While in an age of global migrations, multilingual speakers have come to outnumber the number of monolingual speakers, literary studies continue to privilege works aimed at a monolingual audience. This is particularly the case in the United States, where “English-only” attitudes have dominated discourse for over a century. This course instead explores literary works that take up residence in the space between two or more languages, whether national or regional—as well as those that attempt to dodge semantic systems altogether. From modernist collage and transense to contemporary poetry of exile, migration, and diaspora, the works we will study, lodged between tongues, lend nuance and fascination to debates surrounding “global literature” and untranslatability. We will examine the formal and social prompts and repercussions of experiments in polylingualism, barbarism, dialect, creole, and thwarted translation, and will delve into examples of the potential for mixed/new media poetics to accommodate multiple linguistic systems. While it is not at all necessary for students to be fluent in more than one language to take this course, some experience learning or attempting to learn languages beyond English is essential. Texts up for discussion may include George Steiner’s After Babel, Emily Apter’s Against World Literature, Futurist and Zaum.|Jennifer Scappettone|[54667]|1|Undergraduate|SEM

Like other classic Chicago general education courses, this sequence provides students with both practical programming skills and core ideas in computer science in interdisciplinary applications. Students learn how to perform in a multi-platform (Mac/Linux/Windows) environment using a high-level prototyping framework (LiveCode) that allows for the quick creation of useful “apps” for all platforms — mobile, tablet, and desktop. LiveCode is a free application that can be installed on student computers. As a classic Core course in the Chicago tradition, the course presents introductory techniques of problem solving, algorithm construction, program coding, and debugging as interdisciplinary arts adaptable to a wide range of disciplines with their specialized problems especially since programming is an integral part of almost all disciplines. The first course moves through a sequence from step-by-step introductory labs, to labs that require independent analysis and solution, to a student-designed final project. (The second course (CMSC 11100) consists of several scientific and humanistic projects such as Turing Machines, biological modeling, and language manipulation with another final project.

It is an atmosphere, mood or perhaps a theme that movies have explores since nearly the beginning of cinema (or perhaps even before..) To explore this term this class will draw largely on a tradition of commentary on the German word Das Unheimliche, usually translated as uncanny, that can be traced among Ernst Jentsch, Sigmund Freud, and Martin Heidegger and its relevance to film studies. Freud and his disciple Otto Rank before 1920 related the uncanny to the cinema, and cinema’s ability to evoke the uncanny has been frequently observed. On the one hand, the cinema’s ability to portray uncanny events (as in Rank and Freud’s invocation of the 1913 film the Student in Prague) appears generically in films of fantasy or horror. In addition, some theorists have felt that film as a medium could be best approached via the uncanny. In this class, we will read a series of the key texts and try to survey the terrain of the concept of the uncanny. We will screen films that evoke the experience through their narrative and stylistics, and we will discuss the usefulness of the term for theorizing both film and electronic media, both new and old.|Thomas R Gunning|[43909]|1|Undergraduate|LEC

The New Latin American Cinema (NLAC) of the late 1950s-70s generated unprecedented international enthusiasm for Latin American film production. The filmmakers of this loosely designated movement were defining themselves in relation to global realist film traditions like Italian Neorealism and Griersonian documentary, in relation to--mostly failed-- experiments in building Hollywood-style national film industries, and in relation to regional discourses of underdevelopment and mestizaje. Since the late 1990s, a reassessment of the legacy of the NLAC has been taking shape as scholars have begun to interrogate its canonical status in the face of a changed political climate. In the sphere of filmmaking, contemporary Latin American new wave cinemas are also grappling with that legacy-sometimes disavowing it, sometimes appropriating it. We will situate the NLAC in its historical context, survey its formal achievements and political aspirations, assess its legacy, and take stock of the ways and the reasons that it haunts contemporary production.|Salome Skvirsky|[43923]|1|Undergraduate|SEM

It very much depends on what we would consider a Chinese musical. To answer Adrian Martin’s call for “Musical Mutations: Before, Beyond and Against Hollywood,” this course will look for Chinese musicals in both obvious and unlikely places. The “musical mutations” under discussion include traditional opera adaptation, back-stage opera film, martial-arts opera film, Maoist opera film, musical comedy, song-and-dance film, melo-drama, Hong Kong musical, and most certainly the “apocalyptic” musical named by Martin, The Hole (Tsai Ming-liang, 1998).

It will also look at other forms of documentary media, such as photograpy and written reportage. We will pay particular attention to the political and social movements in which these filmmakers and artists participated--from Pacific War-era propaganda to 1960s radicalism. We will also look at theoretical approaches to documentary produced in Japan and elsewhere. What kind of reality does documentary seek to represent? How is this reality constructed--both aesthetically and politically?|Marianne Tarcov|[54183]|1|Undergraduate|LEC

We will engage in rigorous examination of the transformations of cinematic forms and contents, and of the social, cultural and political elements bound up with those transformations. Over the quarter, you will also learn the tools necessary to analyze documentaries. The course assumes no prior knowledge of film or documentary theory. Each week we will engage with theoretical or analytical readings, through which we will explore 1) how particular ethics and politics are imbricated in various documentary modes and genres and 2) the specific cases of Japanese documentaries and their styles/techniques, measuring them against today’s media regime (and measuring that regime against them). Various traces of Japanese documentary filmmaking practice can be seen carried forward and extended in cinematic creations worldwide, from works by Chris Marker, Abbas Kiarostami and Wim Wenders to recent independent documentaries in East Asia. To locate such traces in the transnational framework, the final sections of the course will be devoted to China’s new documentary film movement since the 1990s and contemporary Taiwanese documentaries.|Takuya Tsunoda|[54725]|1|Undergraduate|LEC

We will then consider its influence on contemporary art cinema, from Aleksandr Sokurov and Béla Tarr to Nuri Bilge Ceylan and Alejandro González Iñárritu (Birdman). Along the way we will also consider the long-take style in documentary cinema, and will also consider the links between long-take cinema and certain tendencies in video art, exemplified by the work in video of Sharon Lockhart and James Benning. We will close by considering the feature films of artists Steve McQueen and Lucien Castaing-Taylor. Treating long-take style as a distinct approach to cinematic realism, in each case we will evaluate the claims made for the ethical, metaphysical and even political valences of the long take, with readings by filmmakers and by theorists from Henri Bergson and André Bazin to Gilles Deleuze, Jacques Rancière, Laura Mulvey and beyond.|Robert Bird|[43931]|1|Undergraduate|LEC

The first part of the course will offer an overview of the critical literature on melodrama and a survey of significant film melodramas from around the world. In the second part of the course, we will narrow our focus to melodramas from the two regions: the United States and Latin America. The conceit of the course is to put different regional traditions of melodrama into conversation. In addition to offering a basic orientation, the class will also test the boundaries of the category in our work on the racial melodrama and the conjuncture of documentary form and melodrama. Other topics will include melodrama as a mode and as a genre; melodrama and national allegory; melodrama and revolution; melodrama and realism; melodrama and emotion; melodrama and the temporally displaced spectator.|Salome Skvirsky|[54715]|1|Undergraduate|LEC

He asked the question hanging in the minds of generations of filmmakers around the world, most likely including Lubitsch himself. In a career spanning nearly three decades, Lubitsch’s name has come to denote a style about style, first exported from Germany to Hollywood and then from Hollywood to the world. In this sense, Lubitsch is first and foremost a filmmaker for filmmakers, and his style decidedly an international one. It is the goal of this course to examine a broadly defined international stylistic history developed by and associated with Lubitsch, whose legacy cannot be adequately assessed without such a perspective. With dual emphases on formal and historical analyses, we will look at Lubitsch’s early Weimar comedy and epic films, American silent masterpieces, musicals, sound comedies, and political farces, as well as Lubitsch-esque films made in Japan, China, and France.|Xinyu Dong|[43948]|1|Undergraduate|LEC

It will explore historical and theoretical issues related to the mutual interactions between cinema and theatre also discussing cinematographic techniques in playwriting as exemplified in plays by Henrik Ibsen (e.g. Peer Gynt) and August Strindberg (e.g. A Dream Play and The Ghost Sonata). Throughout most of his creative career Bergman worked both in theatre and film and even if he is mostly known outside of Sweden as a film director, his theatrical career was as innovative. The work of the film-auteur and the theatre director are for Bergman closely connected, not only through the actors he worked with – during summers for the screen and during the theatre seasons in stage productions – but also through the choice of themes, which are often in direct dialogue with each other in the two media, generating complex meta-aesthetic, inter-medial discourses, depicting and problematizing the work and role of the artist in a broad range of social and ideological contexts.

In this class, we will examine the fundamental literature, both historical and theoretical, on these topics as they span the history of the field, and as they also introduce the related concepts of mass culture, the public sphere, identification, female/queer/black/resistant spectatorship, among others. While the class will additionally provide the student with methodological skills for researching audiences and film receptions, we will also consider concepts such as the mob and mob violence; the politics, theory, and aesthetics of assembly; uprisings; and occupations.

How do new media represent scientific processes and expertise? What are the particular habits and patterns produces by new media technologies? And how do they affect medical research methods and practice? Readings and screenings draw from across the sciences, social sciences, and humanities, and range from scholarly works to news articles, blog posts, videos, and mobile apps. Students will be asked to analyze, operate, and play with scientific new media. Central texts include recent science-driven films, like Contagion and The Martian, virtual dissection and surgical training smartphone apps, and pandemic games Infection and Bio Inc.

Through a series of group exercises, students will put their hands on equipment and solve technical and aesthetic problems, learning to operate and care for the 16mm Bolex film camera; prime lenses; Sekonic light meter; Sachtler tripod; and Arri light kit and accessories. For a final project, students will plan and produce footage for an individual or small group short film. The first half the class will be highly structured, with demonstrations, in-class shoots and lectures. As the semester continues, class time will open up to more of a workshop format to address the specific concerns and issues that arise in the production of the final projects.

The “musical mutations” under discussion include traditional opera adaptation, back-stage opera film, martial-arts opera film, Maoist opera film, musical comedy, song-and-dance film, melo-drama, Hong Kong musical, and most certainly the “apocalyptic” musical named by Martin, The Hole (Tsai Ming-liang, 1998). The tripartite developments of Chinese-language cinemas provide a privileged site to chart the ways the musical genre expands, transforms, and rejuvenates across time and borders.|Xinyu Dong|[43913]|1|Graduate|LEC

It will also look at other forms of documentary media, such as photograpy and written reportage. We will pay particular attention to the political and social movements in which these filmmakers and artists participated--from Pacific War-era propaganda to 1960s radicalism. We will also look at theoretical approaches to documentary produced in Japan and elsewhere. What kind of reality does documentary seek to represent? How is this reality constructed--both aesthetically and politically?|Marianne Tarcov|[54185]|1|Graduate|LEC

We will engage in rigorous examination of the transformations of cinematic forms and contents, and of the social, cultural and political elements bound up with those transformations. Over the quarter, you will also learn the tools necessary to analyze documentaries. The course assumes no prior knowledge of film or documentary theory. Each week we will engage with theoretical or analytical readings, through which we will explore 1) how particular ethics and politics are imbricated in various documentary modes and genres and 2) the specific cases of Japanese documentaries and their styles/techniques, measuring them against today’s media regime (and measuring that regime against them). Various traces of Japanese documentary filmmaking practice can be seen carried forward and extended in cinematic creations worldwide, from works by Chris Marker, Abbas Kiarostami and Wim Wenders to recent independent documentaries in East Asia. To locate such traces in the transnational framework, the final sections of the course will be devoted to China’s new documentary film movement since the 1990s and contemporary Taiwanese documentaries.|Takuya Tsunoda|[54727]|1|Graduate|LEC

We will then consider its influence on contemporary art cinema, from Aleksandr Sokurov and Béla Tarr to Nuri Bilge Ceylan and Alejandro González Iñárritu (Birdman). Along the way we will also consider the long-take style in documentary cinema, and will also consider the links between long-take cinema and certain tendencies in video art, exemplified by the work in video of Sharon Lockhart and James Benning. We will close by considering the feature films of artists Steve McQueen and Lucien Castaing-Taylor. Treating long-take style as a distinct approach to cinematic realism, in each case we will evaluate the claims made for the ethical, metaphysical and even political valences of the long take, with readings by filmmakers and by theorists from Henri Bergson and André Bazin to Gilles Deleuze, Jacques Rancière, Laura Mulvey and beyond.|Robert Bird|[43933]|1|Graduate|LEC

The first part of the course will offer an overview of the critical literature on melodrama and a survey of significant film melodramas from around the world. In the second part of the course, we will narrow our focus to melodramas from the two regions: the United States and Latin America. The conceit of the course is to put different regional traditions of melodrama into conversation. In addition to offering a basic orientation, the class will also test the boundaries of the category in our work on the racial melodrama and the conjuncture of documentary form and melodrama. Other topics will include melodrama as a mode and as a genre; melodrama and national allegory; melodrama and revolution; melodrama and realism; melodrama and emotion; melodrama and the temporally displaced spectator.|Salome Skvirsky|[54717]|1|Graduate|LEC

He asked the question hanging in the minds of generations of filmmakers around the world, most likely including Lubitsch himself. In a career spanning nearly three decades, Lubitsch’s name has come to denote a style about style, first exported from Germany to Hollywood and then from Hollywood to the world. In this sense, Lubitsch is first and foremost a filmmaker for filmmakers, and his style decidedly an international one. It is the goal of this course to examine a broadly defined international stylistic history developed by and associated with Lubitsch, whose legacy cannot be adequately assessed without such a perspective. With dual emphases on formal and historical analyses, we will look at Lubitsch’s early Weimar comedy and epic films, American silent masterpieces, musicals, sound comedies, and political farces, as well as Lubitsch-esque films made in Japan, China, and France.|Xinyu Dong|[43950]|1|Graduate|LEC

It will explore historical and theoretical issues related to the mutual interactions between cinema and theatre also discussing cinematographic techniques in playwriting as exemplified in plays by Henrik Ibsen (e.g. Peer Gynt) and August Strindberg (e.g. A Dream Play and The Ghost Sonata). Throughout most of his creative career Bergman worked both in theatre and film and even if he is mostly known outside of Sweden as a film director, his theatrical career was as innovative. The work of the film-auteur and the theatre director are for Bergman closely connected, not only through the actors he worked with – during summers for the screen and during the theatre seasons in stage productions – but also through the choice of themes, which are often in direct dialogue with each other in the two media, generating complex meta-aesthetic, inter-medial discourses, depicting and problematizing the work and role of the artist in a broad range of social and ideological contexts. Interested 3rd and 4th year undergraduates allowed by instructor consent. ATTENDANCE AT FIRST CLASS SESSION IS MANDATORY.|Freddie Rokem|[54521]|1|Graduate|LEC

Students pursue a line of artistic inquiry by participating in a process that involves experimentation, reading, gallery visits, critiques, and discussions, but mostly by producing images. Primary emphasis is placed upon the visual articulation of the ideas of students through their work, as well as the verbal expression of their ideas in class discussions, critiques, and artist’s statements. As a vital component of articulating ideas and inquiry, students will refine their skills, e.g., black and white or color printing, medium or large format camera usage, or experimenting with light-sensitive materials.|Elisabeth Hogeman|[53964]|1|Graduate|STU

The course will emphasize how students can use 16mm technology towards successful cinematography and image design (for use in both analog and digital postproduction scenarios) and how to develop their ideas towards constructing meaning through moving pictures. Through a series of group exercises, students will put their hands on equipment and solve technical and aesthetic problems, learning to operate and care for the 16mm Bolex film camera; prime lenses; Sekonic light meter; Sachtler tripod; and Arri light kit and accessories. For a final project, students will plan and produce footage for an individual or small group short film. The first half the class will be highly structured, with demonstrations, in-class shoots and lectures. As the semester continues, class time will open up to more of a workshop format to address the specific concerns and issues that arise in the production of the final projects.

CRES20802|Mon Wed : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM|Intro To African Civ-2|[]|Rosenwald Hall 329|Open|The second segment of the African Civilizations sequence uses anthropological perspectives to investigate colonial and postcolonial encounters in West and East Africa. The course objective is to show that while colonialism was brutal and oppressive, it was by no means a unidirectional process of domination in which Europeans plundered the African continent and enforced a wholesale adoption of European culture. Rather, scholars today recognize that colonial encounters were complex culture, political, and economic fields of interaction. Africans actively adopted, reworked, and contested colonizers' policies and projects, and Europeans drew heavily from these encounters to form liberal conceptions of self, nation, and society. Over the course of the quarter, students will learn about forms of personhood, political economy, and everyday life in the twentieth century. Course themes will include social reproduction, kinship practices, medicine, domesticity, and development.

CRES24212|Tue Thu : 04:30 PM-05:50 PM|The Chicano Novel and American Literary History|[]|Rosenwald Hall 405|Open|In 1971, the writer Tomás Rivera described the “Chicano renaissance” as a process of self-invention that involved the “exteriorization of our will”—an effort that motivated a “life in search of form.” This course will examine some of the most ambitious works of literature that are the result of this search. Our guiding inquiries will be simultaneously interpretive, theoretical, and historical: What does it mean to think of form as an “exteriorization” of one’s “will”? Whose will do these forms represent (who is the “us” in Rivera’s “our will”)? What representational strategies enable this exteriorization and dramatize its limitations? Why was the novel so often singled out, and why did some feminist writers prefer instead a collection of letters, poems, journal entries, and personal essays? These questions will inform our study of the consolidation of a self-conscious Chicago literature and its attendant literary history. Students of the course will therefore not only become familiar with exciting works of textual art, they will also study the institutional context that enables the consolidation of “a literature,” and a “literary history.” Authors will include José Antonio Villarreal, Tomás Rivera, Rudolfo Anaya, Cherríe Moraga, Ana Castillo, and Gloria Anzaldúa.

Secondly, we will read texts about the post-apartheid period that illuminate the role of advertising in a context in which all have formal political equality, but unequal access to a consumer lifestyle. In most weeks of the course, During most weeks the first class of the week will consider texts that deal with advertising, consumption and race in the context under discussion and the second will engage with texts that lay out theoretical approaches to analyzing advertising, and we will use these to engage with actual examples of ads from the various time periods under discussion. In the last few weeks of the course, we will examine how the specific case of South Africa can elucidate the way linkages between race and consumer citizenship play out in the national context of the US, with its own history of articulation between consumption, politics, and social difference.|Mary Robertson|[53824]|1|Undergraduate|SEM

In referring to that history, we treat a variety of themes, including migration and its impact, the origins and effects of class stratification, the relation of culture and cultural endeavor to collective consciousness, the rise of institutionalized religions, facts and fictions of political empowerment, and the correspondence of Black lives and living to indices of city wellness (services, schools, safety, general civic feeling). This is a history class that situates itself within a robust interdisciplinary conversation. Students can expect to engage works of autobiography and poetry, sociology, documentary photography, and political science as well as more straightforward historical analysis.

The specific focus this term will be ""race and twentieth-century social science."" Readings and discussion will explore the history of the relation between social-science theory and racial thought and practice from the race science of the late-nineteenth century through Franz Boas's cultural relativism to mid-twentieth century notions of a so-called culture of poverty. Our attention will focus on the real-world, especially public policy, implications of social-scientific thought. In addition to active participation in class discussions each student will write a final paper on a selected topic."|Thomas Holt|[42968]|1|Graduate|SEM
CRES33001|Tue : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|Censorship in East Asia:  The Case of Colonial Korea|[]|Wieboldt Hall 301N|Open|This course examines the operation and consequences of censorship in the Japanese Empire, with focus on its effects in colonial Korea. It begins with two basic premises: first, both the Japanese colonial authorities’ measures of repression, and the Korean responses to them, can be understood as noticeably more staunch and sophisticated when compared to any other region of the Empire; and second, the censorship practices in Korea offers itself as a case that is in itself an effective point of comparison to better understand other censorship operations in general and the impact of these operations across different regions. With a view to probing an inter- and intra-relationship between censorship practices among a variety of imperial/colonial regions, this course studies the institutions related to censorship, the human agents involved in censorship—both external and internal—and texts and translations that were produced in and outside of Korea, and were subject to censorship. Overall, the course stresses the importance of establishing a comparative understanding of the functions of censorship, and on the basis of this comparative thinking we will strive to conceptualize the characteristics of Japanese colonial censorship in Korea.|Kyeong-Hee Choi|[53788]|1|Graduate|SEM

Issues to be explored include the configuration of urban space and its transformation over time in relation to issues of status, class, and political authority; the formation of the ""city person"" as a form of identity; and the tensions between the real city of lived experience and the imagined city of art and literature. We will pay particular attention to two periods of transformation, the 1870s when the modernizing state made Tokyo its capital, and the period of reconstruction after the devastating earthquake of 1923. Assignments include a final research paper of approximately 15 to 18 pages."|Susan Burns|[42914]|1|Graduate|SEM

In this class, we will both look at how this narrative has been constructed over the last sixty years while also interrogating the centrality of this claim by looking at works troubling its claims by authors such as Anne Petry, Chang Rae Lee, Vladimir Nabokov, and Alice Childress. Alongside fiction, we will be looking at history, advertising, and film that contextualize the rise of the suburbs, helping us understand the key role the suburbs played and continue to play in the accumulation of wealth, racial mobility, second wave feminism, and policing.|Adrienne Brown|[55351]|1|Graduate|SEM

In referring to that history, we treat a variety of themes, including migration and its impact, the origins and effects of class stratification, the relation of culture and cultural endeavor to collective consciousness, the rise of institutionalized religions, facts and fictions of political empowerment, and the correspondence of Black lives and living to indices of city wellness (services, schools, safety, general civic feeling). This is a history class that situates itself within a robust interdisciplinary conversation. Students can expect to engage works of autobiography and poetry, sociology, documentary photography, and political science as well as more straightforward historical analysis. By the end of the class, students should have grounding in Black Chicago's history and an appreciation of how this history outlines and anticipates Black life and racial politics in the modern United States.|Adam Green|[42944]|1|Graduate|LEC

This course will provide an introduction to sociological perspectives on gender, physical and mental health, and medicine while also providing a deep interrogation of the social, institutional, and biological links between gender and health. We will discuss inequalities in morbidity, mortality, and health behaviors of women, men, and transgendered individuals from different race, ethnic, and class backgrounds, and we will use sociological concepts, theories, and methods to understand why these differences appear. Finally, we will examine how medicine as an institution and medical practices as organizations sometimes contribute to and combat gender inequality in health. By the end of the course, you will be familiar with social scientific perspectives on (1) gender, (2) mental and physical health, and (3) the practice of medicine, as well as some of the fundamental debates in current medical sociology and sociology of gender.|Anna Mueller|[43243]|1|Graduate|SEM
CRES55300|Thu : 03:00 PM-05:50 PM|I'm a Slave for You|[]|Walker Museum 403|Open|This course will trace the philosophical, juridical, and literary itinerary of modernity’s impossible subject: the person who enslaves himself. From Grotius to Vitoria through Hobbes and Locke up to Mill and beyond, the one thing that modernity’s self-possessive subject cannot will to alienate, sell, or give away is himself. From this perspective, slavery can only be a relation of domination or as a vanishing moment before the enslaved contracts into servitude. In the process of installing this perspective, philosophical modernity foreclosed myriad philosophical and legal traditions of self-enslavement at the precise moment that slavery itself was generalized as the Atlantic world’s foundational mode of political and social relation. This course will explore how this philosophical bracketing of the problem of auto-enslavement enabled Atlantic modernity to bracket slavery itself as an exceptional, pathological condition; we will then explore how the philosophical coding of humans as free by anthropological default affected the social, legal, and political life of the actually enslaved. The first part of this course will track the impossibilization of auto-enslavement in early modern and Enlightenment philosophical texts on international law, political theory, Biblical hermeneutics, and abolitionism. In the second part of this course, we will examine black and white improvisations with the figure of the self-enslaving subject, reading slave narratives, legal texts and cases.|Christopher Taylor|[55352]|1|Graduate|SEM

In this course we will explore the significance of what Raymond Williams called the ""cultural revolution"" for the lives of ordinary men and women in the United States. This history encompasses subjects that have retained their relevance in contemporary life, including racial and ethnic stereotypes, armchair travel, virtual versus lived reality, authenticity and artifice, mass entertainment, city life, celebrity, and gender.

CRWR10205|Mon : 10:30 AM-01:20 PM|Fundamentals of Fiction|[]|Midway Studios 102|Open|This beginning workshop is designed to encourage and refine your skills in writing fiction. Ideally, it will also refine you as a reader and a critic. We will approach every work of fiction we read, whether published or workshopped, from the writer’s perspective: in terms of form, character, and language, and how the writer succeeds, fails, or innovates in these areas. And since fiction, like any art, is essentially an expression of who we are and how we see the world, we will also begin developing our individual voices as writers. For the course, you will complete one full-length story, which you will present for class critique, and then write a significant revision of that story, which you will either present for a second workshop or turn into the instructor at the end of the quarter. The course will also include a series of writing exercises and readings in canonical and contemporary short fiction, all intended to stoke your creativity and illuminate the aesthetic traditions that inform your work.|Augustus Rose|[53599]|2|Undergraduate|SEM

This class will forgo the magic and concentrate on how a story is built: the architecture of structure, the mechanisms of character development, the fluid dynamics of dialogue. We’ll take a close look at some of the building blocks that make up fiction writing: character, dialogue, plot, point of view, and setting. We’ll also read and discuss a variety of short stories, always with an eye to craft and to what you, as writers, can steal for your own work. That’s right, steal. Much of this class is devoted to learning how to steal the tools of great fiction writing, then to using those tools to realize your own vision. You’ll write extensively in and out of class, from weekly reading responses to writing exercises that build toward a polished piece of work. Finally, you will write a complete draft and one extensive revision of a short story or novel chapter.

It will expose students to ways that poets have both employed and resisted patterns in meter, line, and rhyme, and it will ask students to experiment with constraints as a way of playing with formal limitations in their own poems. Students will also explore innovations in diction, syntax, and voice, and apply what they learn from these investigations in workshop discussions. While delving into work by both canonical and emerging poets, students will draft and revise a significant portfolio of their own poems.|Peter O'Leary|[53602]|1|Undergraduate|SEM

CRWR12018|Wed : 03:00 PM-05:50 PM|Special Topics in Fiction: The Young Adult Novel|[]|Midway Studios 102|Open|The books and stories we read as teenagers are often some of the most influential in developing our tastes as adult readers and writers of fiction. In this advanced workshop class, we’ll discuss the genre of young adult literature through evaluation of your own writing: what are its defining characteristics, and what’s the difference between writing for a young adult audience versus writing books and stories about teenagers but designed for adult readers? Students should be working on book-length projects involving teenaged protagonists, no matter the intended audience; please come to the first session with either work to submit or a sense of when you’d be able to sign up for a slot. We’ll spend most of our time evaluating student work, learning how to become both generous and rigorous critics, and we’ll also talk about the books that influenced us the most as young adult readers and the books we’re reading today, from contemporary writers like John Green and Rainbow Rowell to classic authors like S.E. Hinton and Madeleine L’Engle. Students will read at least one or two novels during the quarter as well. Instructor consent required. Submit writing sample via www.creativewriting.uchicago.edu.

CRWR12020|Thu : 03:00 PM-05:50 PM|Special Topics in Fiction: Literary Horror|[]|Midway Studios 108|Open|Fiction has many strategies for defamiliarizing the familiar, for destabilizing the ways we habitually think and feel about ourselves and our realities. Horror stories, considered broadly, go about this estranging work in more concerted ways, luring their characters into zones of emotional and perceptual extremity, violence, and metaphysical dislocation. In this course, we will pinpoint techniques used by (mostly) contemporary writers to deliver shades of fear in narratives rich enough to reward multiple readings. We’ll examine ways writers have engaged the tropes familiar to horror—e.g., doppelgangers, paranoia, the uncanny, the proximity of evil—in stories with complex characters, immersive sensory worlds, realistic social milieux, and potent ideas. Special attention will be paid to the uses of voice, atmosphere, and narrative architecture. Readings may include Henry James, Paul Bowles, Angela Carter, Ian McEwan, Joyce Carol Oates, Alice Munro, William Gay, David Foster Wallace, Reynolds Price, Mary Gaitskill, Kevin Brockmeier, and Karen Russell. While the course topic is meant to provoke and inform your own writing, the original fiction you submit for workshop need not be limited by theme or aesthetic.|Brian Booker|[53608]|1|Undergraduate|SEM
CRWR12122|Thu : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|Introduction to Genres: Parody|[]|TBA|Open|Beginning writers are often told to “imitate” the work of “great authors” in order to discover their own voices. One way to enliven this artistic apprenticeship is to copy masterpieces from literary history with great care, but with a comic touch, too. Imitation with a difference—think Pride and Prejudice and Zombies—is the soul of parody, and in this course we’ll make mockeries of poetry, fiction, and essayistic nonfiction from the history of Western literature in order to learn how art works. Parodying Gertrude Stein’s parallax portraiture can illuminate the inner workings of literary mimesis itself. Satirizing Clarice Lispector’s proliferating points of view can teach us about the limits of perspective in narrative art. Satirizing Junishiro Tanizaki’s essayistic praise of shadows, we can study the role of polemic in literary nonfiction. By the end of the quarter, you’ll have written several imitations of major literary works, and, en route, you will have hopefully learned something about your own voice as a literary artist.|Srikanth Reddy|[53611]|1|Graduate|SEM
CRWR12125|Mon : 03:00 PM-05:00 PM|Reading as a Writer: From Page to Film|[]|Midway Studios 108|Open|We often say of film adaptations: it’s not as good as the book. But what can we, as readers and writers, learn from that unsuccessful transition to the screen? And more intriguingly, what can we learn from the successful ones, the films that are just as good if not better than the original written work—or so vastly different that they become their own entity? In this class, we will be reading works of short fiction and also “reading” their film adaptations, focusing on this relationship between storytelling on the page and storytelling on the screen and what is both lost and gained in that transition. If filmmaking requires a different language than fiction writing, a different approach to things like character, plot, atmosphere, even thematic development, what can we learn from that approach that we can apply to our own fiction, even if we have no interest in making films? We’ll investigate this question in the work of writers like James Joyce, Andre Dubus, and Stephen King, and filmmakers like Hitchcock, Huston, and Wilder.|Vu Tran|[53612]|1|Undergraduate|SEM
CRWR13017|Thu : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|Special Topics in Poetry: Image, Perception, Sense|[]|TBA|Open|In this special topics course we will investigate and experiment with various approaches to imagery. Some fundamental questions will include: What are the variants of the image in poetry, and how do these variants create different stances in the poem? How does the image interface with formal attributes, such as sound, rhythm, and line breaks? Does a poetic image necessarily entail a representational mode of thinking, or are their variations that resist literary mimesis? Is abstraction really antithetical to the image, as is often assumed, or are there ways that, in poems, abstraction and imagery work in chorus? We will discuss radically different approaches to poetic image making (e.g. synesthetic, collaged, surrealist, eco-poetic, iterative, abstract, juxtapositional, absurdist, haiku, etc.) and the aesthetic effects and values that they entail. We will also compare poetry’s sensory images to select practices in music, painting, photography, and film. Workshop discussions will focus on sensory elements of students’ poems and the poem as an organ of perception and feelings. Readings may include work by Bernard Badiou, Charles Baudelaire, André Breton, Mark Doty, Ezra Pound, William Carlos Williams, H.D., Elizabeth Bishop, Jared Stanley, Mei Mei Berssenbrugge, Francis Ponge, and others. Students should plan to submit a poem a week, write a short craft essay, serve once as a discussion leader, comment on peers’ work, and participate in workshops.|Nathan Hoks|[53614]|1|Undergraduate|SEM

We will analyze these different techniques with a focus on each of the writer's narrator/characters. We will try to emulate these two writers through essays that engage walking and dialogue as primary shaping devices. We will also discuss the beauty and grace found in their sentences.|David Maclean|[53616]|1|Undergraduate|SEM
CRWR21501|Wed : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|Advanced Translation Workshop: Found in Translation|[]|Logan Center 802|Open|The current dominance of English makes it hard for English speakers to see the work translators do in making possible the worldwide circulation of ideas and forms. By some reports, the share of translated works in US publishing amounts to no more than five percent of new books. Yet theoretical and empirical studies of translation are on the rise, particularly in places where English is one of several linguistic options. This course will offer opportunities to think through both the theory and practice of this art form and means of cultural transmission, focusing on the problems of translation of and by poets in a variety of languages: it will emphasize precisely the genre most easily “lost in translation,” as the truism goes. It will offer students a chance to try their hands at a range of tactics of translation. Invited speakers with expertise in different languages and methods of translation will supplement our group readings in such authors as Dante, Petrarch, Chaucer, Wyatt, Shelley, Paz, Weinberger, Benjamin, Venuti, Celan, De Campos, Zukofsky, Erin Mouré, Etel Adnan, Anne Carson, and John Cayley.|Jennifer Scappettone|[53618]|1|Undergraduate|SEM

While primarily a workshop, we will also be tracing some of the historical roots of the short story, starting with 19th-century ""tales"" by the likes of Flaubert and Gogol. As we move into the 20th century, we'll read Sherwood Anderson and James Joyce, classic Saturday Evening Post stories by O. Henry and F. Scott Fitzgerald, New Yorker writers like Dorothy Parker and Renata Adler, and also take a brief look at the 1960s/70s avant-garde. We’ll also look at contemporary writers like Lydia Davis and Kelly Link who draw on, respectively, essayistic and Gothic traditions. In our discussions, you will develop a broader, more nuanced understanding of the theories and techniques underpinning fiction writing and work to open up your aesthetic interests.

In this course, we’ll be focusing on the visual arts, and we’ll try to see how reflecting on painting, photography, installation art, and those arts that get called “decorative” gives us ways to consider the object in space, and also history, war, friendship, education, material culture, aesthetics, and coming-of-age. In writing, we will practice all kinds of forms: lyric fragments; polemics; reviews; catalog essays; museum wall texts; personal meditations on a single work; documentation of lost techniques and lost works; and history, criticism, and biography written for readers outside the academy. Students will also write a longer essay to be workshopped in class. We’ll read and discuss writers such as Susan Sontag, Geoff Dyer, Claudia Rankine, Tiana Bighorse, Rebecca Solnit, Zbigniew Herbert, Donald Judd, Octavio Paz, Mark Doty, Hervé Guibert, Kevin Young, Lawrence Weschler, and Walter Benjamin.

This course will be an experiment in linking the extremely pragmatic and the extremely conceptual. Working from a few of the most successful speeches of Presidents Reagan and Obama, we will look to see how the pragmatic and the philosophical shape each other. We will spend roughly half our time on speech-writing nuts-and-bolts, and half our time on some of the philosophical commitments reflected in the language of these two political leaders. (In addition to the speeches themselves, the course reading will include philosophical texts that will provide a frame for examining these commitments.) The course requires weekly exercises, most of which deal with nuts-and-bolts, but a few will analyze the conceptual groundings of the speeches.|Lawrence McEnerney|[40712]|1|Undergraduate|SEM

We’ll spend most of our time evaluating student work, learning how to become both generous and rigorous critics, and we’ll also talk about the books that influenced us the most as young adult readers and the books we’re reading today, from contemporary writers like John Green and Rainbow Rowell to classic authors like S.E. Hinton and Madeleine L’Engle. Students will read at least one or two novels during the quarter as well. Instructor consent required. Submit writing sample via www.creativewriting.uchicago.edu.

CRWR32020|Thu : 03:00 PM-05:50 PM|Special Topics in Fiction: Literary Horror|[]|Midway Studios 108|Open|Fiction has many strategies for defamiliarizing the familiar, for destabilizing the ways we habitually think and feel about ourselves and our realities. Horror stories, considered broadly, go about this estranging work in more concerted ways, luring their characters into zones of emotional and perceptual extremity, violence, and metaphysical dislocation. In this course, we will pinpoint techniques used by (mostly) contemporary writers to deliver shades of fear in narratives rich enough to reward multiple readings. We’ll examine ways writers have engaged the tropes familiar to horror—e.g., doppelgangers, paranoia, the uncanny, the proximity of evil—in stories with complex characters, immersive sensory worlds, realistic social milieux, and potent ideas. Special attention will be paid to the uses of voice, atmosphere, and narrative architecture. Readings may include Henry James, Paul Bowles, Angela Carter, Ian McEwan, Joyce Carol Oates, Alice Munro, William Gay, David Foster Wallace, Reynolds Price, Mary Gaitskill, Kevin Brockmeier, and Karen Russell. While the course topic is meant to provoke and inform your own writing, the original fiction you submit for workshop need not be limited by theme or aesthetic.|Brian Booker|[53609]|1|Graduate|SEM
CRWR33017|Thu : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|Special Topics in Poetry: Image, Perception, Sense|[]|TBA|Open|In this special topics course we will investigate and experiment with various approaches to imagery. Some fundamental questions will include: What are the variants of the image in poetry, and how do these variants create different stances in the poem? How does the image interface with formal attributes, such as sound, rhythm, and line breaks? Does a poetic image necessarily entail a representational mode of thinking, or are their variations that resist literary mimesis? Is abstraction really antithetical to the image, as is often assumed, or are there ways that, in poems, abstraction and imagery work in chorus? We will discuss radically different approaches to poetic image making (e.g. synesthetic, collaged, surrealist, eco-poetic, iterative, abstract, juxtapositional, absurdist, haiku, etc.) and the aesthetic effects and values that they entail. We will also compare poetry’s sensory images to select practices in music, painting, photography, and film. Workshop discussions will focus on sensory elements of students’ poems and the poem as an organ of perception and feelings. Readings may include work by Bernard Badiou, Charles Baudelaire, André Breton, Mark Doty, Ezra Pound, William Carlos Williams, H.D., Elizabeth Bishop, Jared Stanley, Mei Mei Berssenbrugge, Francis Ponge, and others. Students should plan to submit a poem a week, write a short craft essay, serve once as a discussion leader, comment on peers’ work, and participate in workshops.|Nathan Hoks|[53615]|1|Graduate|SEM

Sebald & Teju Cole|[]|Midway Studios 108|Open|While they are both fiction writers, these men employ many classic non-fiction techniques as they tell stories of different diasporic communities. We will analyze these different techniques with a focus on each of the writer's narrator/characters. We will try to emulate these two writers through essays that engage walking and dialogue as primary shaping devices. We will also discuss the beauty and grace found in their sentences.|David Maclean|[53617]|1|Graduate|SEM
CRWR41501|Wed : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|Advanced Translation Workshop: Found in Translation|[]|Logan Center 802|Open|The current dominance of English makes it hard for English speakers to see the work translators do in making possible the worldwide circulation of ideas and forms. By some reports, the share of translated works in US publishing amounts to no more than five percent of new books. Yet theoretical and empirical studies of translation are on the rise, particularly in places where English is one of several linguistic options. This course will offer opportunities to think through both the theory and practice of this art form and means of cultural transmission, focusing on the problems of translation of and by poets in a variety of languages: it will emphasize precisely the genre most easily “lost in translation,” as the truism goes. It will offer students a chance to try their hands at a range of tactics of translation. Invited speakers with expertise in different languages and methods of translation will supplement our group readings in such authors as Dante, Petrarch, Chaucer, Wyatt, Shelley, Paz, Weinberger, Benjamin, Venuti, Celan, De Campos, Zukofsky, Erin Mouré, Etel Adnan, Anne Carson, and John Cayley.|Jennifer Scappettone|[53619]|1|Graduate|SEM
CRWR42100|Tue : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|Advanced Fiction Workshop|[]|Midway Studios 102|Open|"This course is intended as an extension and, in some ways, a reconsideration of many of the lessons learned in introductory fiction courses. While primarily a workshop, we will also be tracing some of the historical roots of the short story, starting with 19th-century ""tales"" by the likes of Flaubert and Gogol. As we move into the 20th century, we'll read Sherwood Anderson and James Joyce, classic Saturday Evening Post stories by O. Henry and F. Scott Fitzgerald, New Yorker writers like Dorothy Parker and Renata Adler, and also take a brief look at the 1960s/70s avant-garde. We’ll also look at contemporary writers like Lydia Davis and Kelly Link who draw on, respectively, essayistic and Gothic traditions. In our discussions, you will develop a broader, more nuanced understanding of the theories and techniques underpinning fiction writing and work to open up your aesthetic interests. For our workshop sessions, you might choose to in some way model your submissions off of any of the outside readings we consider, though this is not a requirement of the course."|William Boast|[53621]|1|Graduate|SEM

CRWR44002|Wed : 10:30 AM-01:20 PM|Advanced Nonfiction Workshop: Writing About the Arts|[]|Cochrane-Woods Art Ctr 153|Open|Writing about the arts has long been a way for writers to investigate the wide world, and to look inward. In this course, we’ll be focusing on the visual arts, and we’ll try to see how reflecting on painting, photography, installation art, and those arts that get called “decorative” gives us ways to consider the object in space, and also history, war, friendship, education, material culture, aesthetics, and coming-of-age. In writing, we will practice all kinds of forms: lyric fragments; polemics; reviews; catalog essays; museum wall texts; personal meditations on a single work; documentation of lost techniques and lost works; and history, criticism, and biography written for readers outside the academy. Students will also write a longer essay to be workshopped in class. We’ll read and discuss writers such as Susan Sontag, Geoff Dyer, Claudia Rankine, Tiana Bighorse, Rebecca Solnit, Zbigniew Herbert, Donald Judd, Octavio Paz, Mark Doty, Hervé Guibert, Kevin Young, Lawrence Weschler, and Walter Benjamin. Students will make some guided and some independent visits to museums including the Art Institute, the DuSable Museum of African American History, the Smart Museum of Art, the Oriental Institute, and the National Museum of Mexican Arts.|Rachel Cohen|[54763]|1|Graduate|SEM

Beginning in the late eighteenth century with the flowering of revivalist and individualist trends and the explosion of creativity in the woodblock prints of Hokusai and others, we will then turn to examine Western-style architecture and painting in the late nineteenth century; socialism, art criticism, and the emergence of the avant garde in the early twentieth century. Also covered are interwar architectural modernism, art during World War II, and postwar movements such as Gutai and Mono-ha.

We will pay particular attention to the political and social movements in which these filmmakers and artists participated--from Pacific War-era propaganda to 1960s radicalism. We will also look at theoretical approaches to documentary produced in Japan and elsewhere. What kind of reality does documentary seek to represent? How is this reality constructed--both aesthetically and politically?|Marianne Tarcov|[53650]|1|Undergraduate|LEC
EALC20441|Tue : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|Gender, Sexuality, Security Culture, and Protest in Post 3-11 Japan|[{'daytime': 'Wed : 07:00 PM-10:00 PM', 'instructor': 'Staff', 'sectionname': 'Section 1S01 [53655] - SCR Open'}]|TBA|Open|As seen in the visual artist Rokudenashiko’s recent conviction for obscenity for disseminating artistic portrayals of her own vagina, contemporary Japan has faced a heightened level of monitoring and policing, both by the state and in other less formalized realms of society, of marginal and subversive expressions of gender and sexuality. Our primary texts come from popular culture, film, visual art, and literature, which have provided lightning rods for controversy and protest in this charged climate. This course investigates the fraught relationship between marginal expressions of gender and sexuality on the one hand, and society’s notions of security and safety on the other. Whose safety matters? How do women and other minorities use artistic production, within and alongside the realm of popular culture, to advocate for their own conceptions of safety and what it might mean? From the erotic performance of feminine agency found in soft-core pornographic pink films, to the slippage between fantasy and reality found in the staged violence of women’s pro-wrestling, to the eco-feminism of activist Ishimure Michiko, and beyond, this course will explore the state of gender, femininity, and sexual politics in Japan, from the 1960s on into the present day.|Marianne Tarcov|[53654]|1|Undergraduate|LEC
EALC22024|Tue Thu : 12:00 PM-01:20 PM|Mystery Fiction and Japanese Modernity|[]|TBA|Open|This course explores the shifting forms of Japanese mystery fiction and the functions the mystery genre has served both within modern Japanese literature and in Japanese mass culture as a whole. On the one hand, mystery writing in Japanese has proven to be a resilient and popular brand of “low” culture, often excluded from the realm of “pure” literature due to its focus on violence, lawlessness, and perversity. On the other, the treatment of these recurring themes according to established “rules” of the mystery genre has helped promote the creation of a reading public that shares a set of taboos and mores. Meanwhile, the problems tackled incisively by Japanese mystery works are often reflections of the larger societal problems posed by their time—including Westernization, imperial expansion, defeat in the Second World War, the arrival of economic prosperity, the collapse of the bubble economy, political corruption, and a perception of decline in the cohesiveness of community. Through examining mysteries, we will hope to arrive at a better understanding of how Japanese literature and society speak to and alter one another. Course materials include short stories, novels, and film from the 1920s to the present day by such writers and directors as Edogawa Rampo, Matsumoto Seicho, Miyabe Miyuki, Tanizaki Jun’ichiro, Kirino Natsuo, Kurosawa Akira, and Ichikawa Kon. All readings for this course are available in English.|Nicholas Lambrecht|[53662]|1|Undergraduate|LEC
EALC23001|Tue : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|Censorship in East Asia:  The Case of Colonial Korea|[]|Wieboldt Hall 301N|Open|This course examines the operation and consequences of censorship in the Japanese Empire, with focus on its effects in colonial Korea. It begins with two basic premises: first, both the Japanese colonial authorities’ measures of repression, and the Korean responses to them, can be understood as noticeably more staunch and sophisticated when compared to any other region of the Empire; and second, the censorship practices in Korea offers itself as a case that is in itself an effective point of comparison to better understand other censorship operations in general and the impact of these operations across different regions. With a view to probing an inter- and intra-relationship between censorship practices among a variety of imperial/colonial regions, this course studies the institutions related to censorship, the human agents involved in censorship—both external and internal—and texts and translations that were produced in and outside of Korea, and were subject to censorship. Overall, the course stresses the importance of establishing a comparative understanding of the functions of censorship, and on the basis of this comparative thinking we will strive to conceptualize the characteristics of Japanese colonial censorship in Korea.|Kyeong-Hee Choi|[53789]|1|Undergraduate|SEM

Nor, despite long-standing stereotypes to the contrary, has it only been the privilege of the elites to disrupt the traditional male-female binary. Readings will address such themes as the ways in which gender defines patterns in family life, in politics and under the law; marriage and homosexuality; prostitution and trafficking; performance and cross dressing; the implementation of the one child policy; gender roles in minority communities; and China's handling of HIV/AIDS. We will consider the role of old Confucian hierarchies and scrutinize the links between industrialization, women's liberation, nationalism, and the communist movement.

Assignments include a final research paper of approximately 15 to 18 pages."|Susan Burns|[42916]|1|Graduate|SEM

This course examines the relationship between the ideas of “indigenous” and “foreign” as embodied by Korean writers in the fields of creative writing, journalism, and academia with a view to engaging and interrogating the idea of “national literature” and its institutional manifestations. It further examines artistic and theoretical endeavors by Korean writers and intellectuals to critically reflect upon and move beyond the unquestioned linguistic, ideological, and ethno-national boundaries.|Kyeong-Hee Choi|[53664]|1|Graduate|LEC

Unlike an isolated female portrait or an individual female symbol, a feminine space is a spatial entity: an artificial world composed of landscape, vegetation, architecture, atmosphere, climate, color, fragrance, light, and sound, as well as selected human occupants and their activities. This course traces the construction of this space in traditional Chinese art (from the second to the eighteenth centuries) and the social/political implications of this constructive process.|Hung-Wu Wu|[54527]|1|Graduate|SEM

EALC43000|Tue : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|Censorship in East Asia:  The Case of Colonial Korea|[]|Wieboldt Hall 301N|Open|This course examines the operation and consequences of censorship in the Japanese Empire, with focus on its effects in colonial Korea. It begins with two basic premises: first, both the Japanese colonial authorities’ measures of repression, and the Korean responses to them, can be understood as noticeably more staunch and sophisticated when compared to any other region of the Empire; and second, the censorship practices in Korea offers itself as a case that is in itself an effective point of comparison to better understand other censorship operations in general and the impact of these operations across different regions. With a view to probing an inter- and intra-relationship between censorship practices among a variety of imperial/colonial regions, this course studies the institutions related to censorship, the human agents involved in censorship—both external and internal—and texts and translations that were produced in and outside of Korea, and were subject to censorship. Overall, the course stresses the importance of establishing a comparative understanding of the functions of censorship, and on the basis of this comparative thinking we will strive to conceptualize the characteristics of Japanese colonial censorship in Korea.|Kyeong-Hee Choi|[53787]|1|Graduate|SEM

EALC43364|Tue : 09:45 AM-11:45 AM|Legal History of Early China|[]|Laird Bell Quadrangle E|Open|The purpose of this course is to enhance the students’ understanding of the application of law and legal theory through study of the growing body of legal texts from pre-imperial and early imperial China. In addition to situating the Chinese legal materials in their varying legal, social, political, cultural and historical contexts, and thereby highlighting some of their unique elements, the course also familiarizes students with a wide range of theoretical materials (eg., anthropological, legal philosophical, economic, etc.) which may be useful in bringing to light any universalities of legal systems and behavior. However, discussion of any given text will be directed in large part by the nature and contents of the material itself. The Chinese materials, all readings of which will be in translation, range from commemorative inscriptions cast in bronze sacral vessels and descriptions of legal practices in received texts, to actual statutes and case records, philosophical texts and legal debates. The medium, discovery/transmission, and authorship of each document will be given due consideration for the effect they may have on our understanding of the contemporary legal context from which the text derives. The course culminates with student presentations on the material of their choice. Preparation for presentations will be conducted in consult with the instructor. Students are encouraged to draw from their study of other legal systems and/or systems of legal thought (both modern and pre-modern) in their discussion of the ancient Chinese material. It is hoped that the course will help students question their own assumptions about legal behavior, and the nature and role of law and legal systems in early China, specifically, and within the human world, generally. Students in Humanities/Social Sciences may apply to take this course.|Laura Skosey|[54757]|1|Graduate|CRS

Because modern economics puts such a heavy stress on mathematical rigor, the most interesting economic ideas often get pushed to the background. In this course, we will explore these big economic ideas, without the math. Our goal is to make the beauty and power of economic thinking available to everyone. We will discuss what it means to think like an economist, how you can use economic thinking to make the world a better place (or to take advantage of your friends and enemies, if you prefer), and also how sometimes thinking like an economist can get you into trouble.|Steven Levitt, John List|[44158]|1|Undergraduate|LEC

We will spend roughly half our time on speech-writing nuts-and-bolts, and half our time on some of the philosophical commitments reflected in the language of these two political leaders. (In addition to the speeches themselves, the course reading will include philosophical texts that will provide a frame for examining these commitments.)

ENGL17818|Mon Wed : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM|Consent and Coercion: Rights, Agency, and Authority in the Eighteenth Century and Beyond|[]|TBA|Open|In American popular culture, the eighteenth century is remembered today (to the extent that it is remembered at all) as a heady time of revolutions and revolutionaries, when towering figures of the Enlightenment established modern democracy. This, in many ways, reflects the narrative eighteenth-century writers were developing about their own age. For British Whigs, the “Glorious Revolution” of 1688 had been a watershed moment at which the arbitrary rule of kings had been replaced for all time by constitutionalism; the social contract and the civil polity had triumphed over divine-right ideology, ushering in a new, beneficent era of progress. And, in the 1790s, the French Revolution fired the political imaginations of British radicals who saw the potential for a world made anew – a world of universal suffrage and gender equality, where slavery was abolished. Clearly, attaining these goals was a long way off. The debates over the structures, meanings, and nature of consent had tendrils in multiple areas of society – the law, of course, but also in understandings of sexuality, constructions of gender, economics, and colonization. Questions of rights, agency, and authority (what those categories meant, who could possess them, and who guaranteed them) were by no means settled, and, indeed, throughout the century, calls to curtail the categories of people who should have access to the sphere of political influence were often as boisterous as those to expand such access. This course will explore how a range of authors in eighteenth-century Britain figured questions of consent, rights, and authority and how the ideological debates these authors mediated continue to inform contemporary politics, cultures, and identities. We will read works by literary figures such as Daniel Defoe, Samuel Richardson, Mary Hays, Olaudah Equiano, and Mary Shelley. We will consider the writings of some of the major political philosophers of the day, as well, including John Locke, Thomas Hobbes, Mary Astell, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Thomas Paine, and Mary Wollstonecraft. We will additionally discuss readings in modern criticism and theory to help us better situate our primary texts in the discourses of modernity and better understand their lasting resonances.|Tristan Schweiger|[42900]|1|Undergraduate|SEM
ENGL17950|Tue Thu : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM|The Declaration of Independence|[]|TBA|Open|This course explores important intellectual, political, philosophical, legal, economic, social, and religious contexts for the Declaration of Independence. We begin with a consideration of the English Revolution, investigating the texts of the Declaration of Rights of 1689 and Locke’s Second Treatise and their meanings to American revolutionaries. We then consider imperial debates over taxation in the 1760s and 1770s, returning Benjamin Franklin’s Autobiography to its original context. Reading Paine’s Common Sense and the letters of Abigail Adams and John Adams we look at the multiple meanings of independence. We study Jefferson’s drafting process, read the Declaration over the shoulders of people on both sides of the Atlantic, and consider clues to contemporary meanings beyond the intentions of Congress. Finally, we briefly engage the post-revolutionary history of the place and meaning of the Declaration in American life. (F)|Eric Slauter|[43737]|1|Undergraduate|SEM

We will address foundational and recent critical approaches to the many “natures” of Romanticism.

ENGL21006|Mon Wed : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM|Joseph Conrad's The Secret Agent: (In)action, Surveillance, Terrorism|[]|TBA|Open|Course centers on Joseph Conrad’s The Secret Agent: A Simple Tale. Contemporary critics often consider this novel the archetypal fictional work about terrorism, as it is based on the bomb attack that occurred in Greenwich in 1888. The Secret Agent demonstrates, however, much more than its prophetic significance rediscovered after 9/11. Therefore, the course seeks how the novel’s relevance stems in equal measure from Conrad’s interest in a wider political process and his distrust of state power; in particular, the course explores how these forces determine the individual caught in a confining situation. We read The Secret Agent as a political novel, that struggle for solutions defies chaos as well as an imposition of a single ideology or one authorial point of view. Its ambiguities and political antinomies allow for interdisciplinary readings that also present an opportunity to critically overview the established approaches to main Conradian themes. In analyzing the formation of the narrative’s ideology we discuss Conrad’s historical pessimism that demonstrates with sustained irony how capitalism breeds social injustice that, in turn, breeds anarchism. The class also focuses on how the novel exposes duplicity in staging surveillance, terrorism, as well as adjacent forms of violence or sacrifice. Critical texts include several older but still influential readings (Jameson, Eagleton) and the most recent.|Bozena Shallcross|[42360]|1|Undergraduate|LEC

ENGL21310|Tue Thu : 12:00 PM-01:20 PM|Our biopolitics, ourselves: feminist science fiction|[]|TBA|Closed|1970s feminist theory made a significant conceptual move in provisionally bracketing off biological sex from the historical/cultural work of gender. Feminist science fiction (in contrast), in its brief flourishing in the 70s and early 80s, finds its utopian moments in the biological, in genetic manipulation, reproductive technology, ecological forms of being and new bodies of a variety of kinds. This class will read science fiction, feminist theory and current critical work that concerns itself with bios, biology and biopolitics in order to ask questions about the divide between nature and culture, what’s entailed in imagining the future, what gender and genre have to do with each other, and just what science fiction is and does anyway. Authors may include: Le Guin, Russ, Butler, Piercy, McIntyre, Haraway, Malabou, Fortunati, James, Rubin, Firestone.|Hilary Strang|[42886]|1|Undergraduate|SEM

ENGL24212|Tue Thu : 04:30 PM-05:50 PM|The Chicano Novel and American Literary History|[]|Rosenwald Hall 405|Open|In 1971, the writer Tomás Rivera described the “Chicano renaissance” as a process of self-invention that involved the “exteriorization of our will”—an effort that motivated a “life in search of form.” This course will examine some of the most ambitious works of literature that are the result of this search. Our guiding inquiries will be simultaneously interpretive, theoretical, and historical: What does it mean to think of form as an “exteriorization” of one’s “will”? Whose will do these forms represent (who is the “us” in Rivera’s “our will”)? What representational strategies enable this exteriorization and dramatize its limitations? Why was the novel so often singled out, and why did some feminist writers prefer instead a collection of letters, poems, journal entries, and personal essays? These questions will inform our study of the consolidation of a self-conscious Chicago literature and its attendant literary history. Students of the course will therefore not only become familiar with exciting works of textual art, they will also study the institutional context that enables the consolidation of “a literature,” and a “literary history.” Authors will include José Antonio Villarreal, Tomás Rivera, Rudolfo Anaya, Cherríe Moraga, Ana Castillo, and Gloria Anzaldúa.

ENGL24260|Mon : 12:30 PM-03:20 PM|Anxiety|[]|TBA|Open|The phenomenon of anxiety emerged as one of the leading psychological disorders of the 20th and 21st centuries. Worrying ourselves into the realm of the pathological, we now have a requisite measure of anxiety for every prescribed stage of life. But why are we so anxious? Considering its prevalence in everyday life, the concept and theories of anxiety have been employed surprisingly seldom as a way into film, fiction, and art. In this course we examine the modern origin of contemporary discourses specific to anxiety and their unique manifestation in cultural artifacts. To understand the complex of anxiety in the so-called Western world, we rely on the theories of Søren Kierkegaard, Martin Heidegger, Sigmund Freud, Jacques Lacan, and Alenka Zupančič; fiction by Stoker, Schnitzler, Kafka, and Sebald; and film by Haneke, Kubrick, Ophuls, and Hitchcock. We will also have guest speakers from the fields of clinical psychiatry, geriatric medicine, philosophy, and comparative anthropology.|Anne Flannery, Malynne Sternstein|[41036]|1|Undergraduate|SEM

ENGL25422|Mon Wed : 03:00 PM-04:20 PM|American Fortunes|[]|TBA|Open|Getting rich quick is practically synonymous with the American Dream. But while a fortune might alleviate financial hardship, it creates problems of its own. Like our present moment, the turn of the 20th century saw rapid changes in technology and finance generate unprecedented wealth inequality. In this period of rapid urbanization and industrialization, writers explored how rapidly changing financial circumstances might change a person’s life. This course surveys major American novels from the late 19th and early 20th centuries to ask questions like: How does money articulate with social class in the context of American political ideology? How do writers represent the moral status and responsibilities of the wealthy as different from those of the poor? What can literary texts tell us about the world in which they were produced and consumed? Readings will include texts by William Dean Howells, Frank Norris, Theodore Dreiser, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Jessie Redmon Fauset. (B, G)|Kevin Kimura|[43753]|1|Undergraduate|SEM

ENGL26250|Tue Thu : 09:00 AM-10:20 AM|Richer and Poorer: Income Inequality|[]|Rosenwald Hall 405|Open|Current political and recent academic debate has centered on income or wealth inequality. Data suggests a rapidly growing divergence between those earners at the bottom and those at the top. This course seeks to place that current concern in conversation with a range of moments in nineteenth and twentieth century history when literature and economics converged on questions of economic inequality. In keeping with recent political economic scholarship by Thomas Piketty, we will be adopting a long historic view and a somewhat wide geographic scale as we explore how economic inequality is represented, measured, assessed, and addressed. Readings will include some of the following literature: Hard Times, Le Pere Goriot, The Jungle, The Time Machine, Native Son, Landscape for a Good Woman, White Tiger; and some of the following economic and political texts: Principles of Political Economy, The Acquisitive Society, The Theory of the Leisure Class, Capital (Marx and Piketty), The Price of Inequality, and Inequality Re-examined.

At the same time, our readings will allow us to explore the ways in which the disgusting has historically been utilized as a way of producing socially critical literature, by representing that which a culture categorically attempts to marginalize, exclude, and expel. Readings will engage with the variety of aesthetic functions that the disgusting has been afforded throughout modern literary history, including the carnivalesque and grotesque in Rabelais and the bawdy and satirical in Swift; revolted Victorian realism and gruesome Zolaesque naturalism; and Sartre’s existential nausea and Kafka’s anxious repulsion; as well as Thomas Bernhard’s experiments with contempt and William Burroughs’ hallucinogenic inversions of pleasure and disgust.

This course explores the influence that the recording, editing, and exhibition of film had on the literary practices of Modernist writers. We will look at the fiction of such writers as Woolf, Joyce, and Elizabeth Bowen; and at Modernist writers’ essays on the medium. How did cinematic experiences of glamor, temporality, anonymity, and technology affect the experiments of writers who wanted to innovate their own medium? How can the emergence of cinema help us think about literary Modernism's approach to narrative and subjectivity? (G)|Sophia Withers|[43762]|1|Undergraduate|SEM

We begin by surveying the development and trajectory of the field, particularly as it develops around debates on revolution and compromise, cosmopolitanism, the psychology of colonialism, and anti-colonial historiography. Alongside this, we consider the recent disciplinary revival of the categories of “global Anglophone” and “world literature” through readings on “literary worlds” to to evaluate these categories, and their contributions to ongoing debates about translation/translatability, vernaculars, rewriting, and mimicry. What are the claims made on behalf of literary texts in orienting us to other lives and possibilities, and in registering the experience of geographic and cultural displacement? To better answer this, we read recent scholarship that engages the field in conversations around intimacy, belonging, and human rights, to think about the impulses that animate the field, and its possible futures. Readings will likely include works by Debjani Ganguly, Kamau Brathwaite, Jean Rhys, Amitava Kumar, Sara Ahmed and Amitav Ghosh.|Darrel Chia|[54369]|1|Undergraduate|SEM

ENGL31006|Mon Wed : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM|Joseph Conrad's The Secret Agent: (In)action, Surveillance, Terrorism|[]|TBA|Open|Course centers on Joseph Conrad’s The Secret Agent: A Simple Tale. Contemporary critics often consider this novel the archetypal fictional work about terrorism, as it is based on the bomb attack that occurred in Greenwich in 1888. The Secret Agent demonstrates, however, much more than its prophetic significance rediscovered after 9/11. Therefore, the course seeks how the novel’s relevance stems in equal measure from Conrad’s interest in a wider political process and his distrust of state power; in particular, the course explores how these forces determine the individual caught in a confining situation. We read The Secret Agent as a political novel, that struggle for solutions defies chaos as well as an imposition of a single ideology or one authorial point of view. Its ambiguities and political antinomies allow for interdisciplinary readings that also present an opportunity to critically overview the established approaches to main Conradian themes. In analyzing the formation of the narrative’s ideology we discuss Conrad’s historical pessimism that demonstrates with sustained irony how capitalism breeds social injustice that, in turn, breeds anarchism. The class also focuses on how the novel exposes duplicity in staging surveillance, terrorism, as well as adjacent forms of violence or sacrifice. Critical texts include several older but still influential readings (Jameson, Eagleton) and the most recent.|Bozena Shallcross|[42361]|1|Graduate|LEC

ENGL37818|Mon Wed : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM|Consent and Coercion: Rights, Agency, and Authority in the Eighteenth Century and Beyond|[]|TBA|Open|In American popular culture, the eighteenth century is remembered today (to the extent that it is remembered at all) as a heady time of revolutions and revolutionaries, when towering figures of the Enlightenment established modern democracy. This, in many ways, reflects the narrative eighteenth-century writers were developing about their own age. For British Whigs, the “Glorious Revolution” of 1688 had been a watershed moment at which the arbitrary rule of kings had been replaced for all time by constitutionalism; the social contract and the civil polity had triumphed over divine-right ideology, ushering in a new, beneficent era of progress. And, in the 1790s, the French Revolution fired the political imaginations of British radicals who saw the potential for a world made anew – a world of universal suffrage and gender equality, where slavery was abolished. Clearly, attaining these goals was a long way off. The debates over the structures, meanings, and nature of consent had tendrils in multiple areas of society – the law, of course, but also in understandings of sexuality, constructions of gender, economics, and colonization. Questions of rights, agency, and authority (what those categories meant, who could possess them, and who guaranteed them) were by no means settled, and, indeed, throughout the century, calls to curtail the categories of people who should have access to the sphere of political influence were often as boisterous as those to expand such access. This course will explore how a range of authors in eighteenth-century Britain figured questions of consent, rights, and authority and how the ideological debates these authors mediated continue to inform contemporary politics, cultures, and identities. We will read works by literary figures such as Daniel Defoe, Samuel Richardson, Mary Hays, Olaudah Equiano, and Mary Shelley. We will consider the writings of some of the major political philosophers of the day, as well, including John Locke, Thomas Hobbes, Mary Astell, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Thomas Paine, and Mary Wollstonecraft. We will additionally discuss readings in modern criticism and theory to help us better situate our primary texts in the discourses of modernity and better understand their lasting resonances.|Tristan Schweiger|[42901]|1|Graduate|SEM
ENGL41102|Tue Thu : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM|The Victorian Unconscious|[]|Rosenwald Hall 405|Open|This course will consider the ways in which Victorian literature and culture can at once explain and be explained by psychoanalytic theory. Taking works by Charlotte and Emily Brontë, Charles Dickens, Henry Mayhew, Thomas Hardy, and Henry James as our principle points of departure, our course will pursue the “Victorian unconscious” through three lines of questioning: First, we will ask how Victorian literature anticipated the development of psychoanalytic concepts, such as the unconscious, repression, infantile sexuality and the symptom. At the same time, we will question whether Freud’s reflections on the psychopathologies of modern culture can in fact help to explain specific structural and social transformations in the 19th century public sphere, like the construction of modern sewer systems, the legal regulation of sexual acts, or the development of obscenity law. Finally, we will interrogate how the unconscious operates as a site of theoretical interest within Marxist and postcolonial critiques of modern imperialism. Our readings of 19th century novels will be complemented by extensive readings in psychoanalytic theory (Freud, Klein, Lacan, Winnicott) and pre-pscyhoanalytic psychiatry (e.g. Esquirol, Tuke, Krafft-Ebing, Charcot, Cotard), as well as relevant works by theorists elaborating and questioning psychoanalytic insights, including George Batailles, Michel Foucault, Jacques Rancière, Frederic Jameson, Edward Said, Kaja Silverman, Lauren Berlant, Eve Kosofsky Sed|Zachary Samalin|[41087]|1|Graduate|SEM

Feminist science fiction (in contrast), in its brief flourishing in the 70s and early 80s, finds its utopian moments in the biological, in genetic manipulation, reproductive technology, ecological forms of being and new bodies of a variety of kinds. This class will read science fiction, feminist theory and current critical work that concerns itself with bios, biology and biopolitics in order to ask questions about the divide between nature and culture, what’s entailed in imagining the future, what gender and genre have to do with each other, and just what science fiction is and does anyway.

ENGL55300|Thu : 03:00 PM-05:50 PM|I'm a Slave for You|[]|Walker Museum 403|Open|This course will trace the philosophical, juridical, and literary itinerary of modernity’s impossible subject: the person who enslaves himself. From Grotius to Vitoria through Hobbes and Locke up to Mill and beyond, the one thing that modernity’s self-possessive subject cannot will to alienate, sell, or give away is himself. From this perspective, slavery can only be a relation of domination or as a vanishing moment before the enslaved contracts into servitude. In the process of installing this perspective, philosophical modernity foreclosed myriad philosophical and legal traditions of self-enslavement at the precise moment that slavery itself was generalized as the Atlantic world’s foundational mode of political and social relation. This course will explore how this philosophical bracketing of the problem of auto-enslavement enabled Atlantic modernity to bracket slavery itself as an exceptional, pathological condition; we will then explore how the philosophical coding of humans as free by anthropological default affected the social, legal, and political life of the actually enslaved. The first part of this course will track the impossibilization of auto-enslavement in early modern and Enlightenment philosophical texts on international law, political theory, Biblical hermeneutics, and abolitionism. In the second part of this course, we will examine black and white improvisations with the figure of the self-enslaving subject, reading slave narratives, legal texts and cases.|Christopher Taylor|[41089]|1|Graduate|SEM

ENGL57100|Thu : 10:30 AM-01:20 PM|From Pentecost to Babel: Writing Between Languages|[]|TBA|Open|What happens to literary works whose authors think in more than one language, and allow that excess to be registered in their texts? While in an age of global migrations, multilingual speakers have come to outnumber the number of monolingual speakers, literary studies continue to privilege works aimed at a monolingual audience. This is particularly the case in the United States, where “English-only” attitudes have dominated discourse for over a century. This course instead explores literary works that take up residence in the space between two or more languages, whether national or regional—as well as those that attempt to dodge semantic systems altogether. From modernist collage and transense to contemporary poetry of exile, migration, and diaspora, the works we will study, lodged between tongues, lend nuance and fascination to debates surrounding “global literature” and untranslatability. We will examine the formal and social prompts and repercussions of experiments in polylingualism, barbarism, dialect, creole, and thwarted translation, and will delve into examples of the potential for mixed/new media poetics to accommodate multiple linguistic systems. While it is not at all necessary for students to be fluent in more than one language to take this course, some experience learning or attempting to learn languages beyond English is essential. Texts up for discussion may include George Steiner’s After Babel, Emily Apter’s Against World Literature, Futurist and Zaum.|Jennifer Scappettone|[41090]|1|Graduate|SEM

We will present the major components of these strategies as found in several asset classes (equities, futures, credit, FX, interest rates and energy). A large proportion of the models involved in quantitative strategies are expressible in terms of regressions. We will cover most of the ways they are used, including practical tricks and considerations, and concentrating particularly on achieving trustworthy performance. Mathematically, we will cover the computation of linear regressions with and without weights, in univariate and multivariate cases, having least squares or other objective functions. Of the major computation technologies actively used by the finance industry (C/C++, Matlab, Java, R, VB/Excel, C\#, Python) we have chosen R and Python for numerical computation, with (very) light usage of Excel and with data coming from Quandl and some proprietary sources.|Brian Boonstra|[54770]|1|Graduate|LEC

FNDL21006|Mon Wed : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM|Joseph Conrad's The Secret Agent: (In)action, Surveillance, Terrorism|[]|TBA|Open|Course centers on Joseph Conrad’s The Secret Agent: A Simple Tale. Contemporary critics often consider this novel the archetypal fictional work about terrorism, as it is based on the bomb attack that occurred in Greenwich in 1888. The Secret Agent demonstrates, however, much more than its prophetic significance rediscovered after 9/11. Therefore, the course seeks how the novel’s relevance stems in equal measure from Conrad’s interest in a wider political process and his distrust of state power; in particular, the course explores how these forces determine the individual caught in a confining situation. We read The Secret Agent as a political novel, that struggle for solutions defies chaos as well as an imposition of a single ideology or one authorial point of view. Its ambiguities and political antinomies allow for interdisciplinary readings that also present an opportunity to critically overview the established approaches to main Conradian themes. In analyzing the formation of the narrative’s ideology we discuss Conrad’s historical pessimism that demonstrates with sustained irony how capitalism breeds social injustice that, in turn, breeds anarchism. The class also focuses on how the novel exposes duplicity in staging surveillance, terrorism, as well as adjacent forms of violence or sacrifice. Critical texts include several older but still influential readings (Jameson, Eagleton) and the most recent.|Bozena Shallcross|[42362]|1|Undergraduate|LEC

FNDL21714|Mon : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|Boccaccio's Decameron|[]|TBA|Open|One of the most important and influential works of the middle ages—and a lot funnier than the Divine Comedy. Boccaccio’s Decameron, written in the midst of the social disruption caused by the Black Death (1348), may have held readers attention for centuries because of its bawdiness, but it is also a profound exploration into the basis of faith and the meaning of death, the status of language, the construction of social hierarchy and social order, and the nature of crisis and historical change. Framed by a story telling contest between seven young ladies and three young men who have left the city to avoid the plague, the one hundred stories of the Decameron form a structural masterpiece that anticipates Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales, the Renaissance epics, and the modern short story. We will especially focus on how the work explores the intersection of legal and literary representation but students will be encouraged to further explore in individual projects the many topics raised by the text, including (and in addition to the themes mentioned above) magic, the visual arts, mercantile culture, travel and discovery, and new religious practices.|Justin Steinberg|[54801]|1|Undergraduate|SEM

FNDL24403|Tue : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|Herodotus and Thucydides: History and Politics|[]|TBA|Open|In this course we read Herodotus and Thucydides not only as historians but as political thinkers. The course will be organized around an intensive engagement with two central texts: Herodotus’ Histories and Thucydides’ History of the Peloponnesian War. As we read through these works, we will also take up the wider historical and political context—e.g., the fifth-century rise of Athenian democracy and imperialism—and the relationship between our texts and other genres, including philosophy, drama, and rhetoric. The aim of the course is not only to give students a close familiarity with our two authors and some of the scholarship surrounding them, but also, more broadly, to think through the relationship between political theory and history. How might political theory guide the writing of history, and how can history contribute to theorizing politics? What can our reading of Herodotus and Thucydides tell us about how to think about these questions in different eras and contexts?

Themes to be addressed include the problem of genre and the uses of tradition; the nature of history and its relationship to place; the activity of creation and its relationship to language, beauty, evil, and power; the role of monsters in imagination and criticism; the twinned challenges of death and immortality, fate and free will; and the interaction between the world of ""faerie"" and religious belief."|Rachel Fulton|[42964]|1|Undergraduate|LEC

And given the fact that his work so often deals, if only indirectly, with the Holocaust and its aftershocks, his work has furthermore been associated with that highly problematic generic and historical constellation, “Holocaust literature.” The seminar will address all of Sebald’s major works in the hope of elucidating this singular intersection of historical and literary complexity.|Eric L Santner|[54477]|1|Undergraduate|SEM

This erudite Polish author is a prime 20th century modernist whose novels, entangled in an ongoing battle with fundamental questions and, indeed, with existence itself, explode with uncanny laughter. In contrast to many of his contemporary writers who established their reputation by applying existing philosophical models, Gombrowicz employed ironically his philosophical erudition, while engaging in his philosophical récit the literary and cultural tropes which derived from his Polish cultural heritage. Over the next ten weeks, we will investigate how he twisted these references and tropes to inform a distinctly Gombrowiczian version of performative philosophy. We will read Gombrowicz’s novels, lectures on philosophy and some of his autobiographical writings to seek answers to our overarching question: what makes this author a philosopher?|Bozena Shallcross|[42356]|1|Undergraduate|LEC

Originally published in 1943, it is one of Strauss’s most intransigent essays. I shall also discuss “On Classical Political Philosophy” (1945), “The Spirit of Sparta or the Taste of Xenophon” (1939), and “Farabi’s Plato” (1945).|Heinrich Meier|[43987]|1|Undergraduate|SEM

We begin with a consideration of the English Revolution, investigating the texts of the Declaration of Rights of 1689 and Locke’s Second Treatise and their meanings to American revolutionaries. We then consider imperial debates over taxation in the 1760s and 1770s, returning Benjamin Franklin’s Autobiography to its original context. Reading Paine’s Common Sense and the letters of Abigail Adams and John Adams we look at the multiple meanings of independence. We study Jefferson’s drafting process, read the Declaration over the shoulders of people on both sides of the Atlantic, and consider clues to contemporary meanings beyond the intentions of Congress. Finally, we briefly engage the post-revolutionary history of the place and meaning of the Declaration in American life. (F)|Eric Slauter|[43738]|1|Undergraduate|SEM

GEOG40217|Mon Wed : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM|Spatial Regression Analysis|[]|TBA|Open|This course covers statistical and econometric methods specifically geared to the problems of spatial dependence and spatial heterogeneity in cross-sectional data. The main objective of the course is to gain insight into the scope of spatial regression methods, to be able to apply them in an empirical setting, and to properly interpret the results of spatial regression analysis. While the focus is on spatial aspects, the types of methods covered have general validity in statistical practice. The course covers the specification of spatial regression models in order to incorporate spatial dependence and spatial heterogeneity, as well as different estimation methods and specification tests to detect the presence of spatial autocorrelation and spatial heterogeneity. Special attention is paid to the application to spatial models of generic statistical paradigms, such as Maximum Likelihood, Generalized Methods of Moments and the Bayesian perspective. An important aspect of the course is the application of open source software tools such as R, GeoDa and PySal to solve empirical problems.|Luc Anselin|[42094]|1|Graduate|LEC

GLST24105|Mon Wed : 10:30 AM-11:50 AM|Rethinking the Middle East|[]|TBA|Open|Where is the Middle East, how do we go about studying it and why does it matter? This course explores the emergence of the 'Middle East' as an object of inquiry; a place with a people and a culture set in opposition to the 'West'. It asks how these categories are constituted, by whom, and with what consequence. How do they define the contours of political community, the possibilities for empathy and understanding or the limits of rights and moral obligation? The historical and contemporary texts assigned draw attention to the layered and shifting meanings of these categories, and in turn to the geopolitical and epistomological worlds that give rise to them. By putting these texts into conversation with each other the course engages a number of key issues that have occupied social theorists: the relationship between power and knowledge, the politics of representation, and the nature of social theory more generally.|Yaqub Hilal|[43387]|1|Undergraduate|SEM

We will particularly focus on the occult sciences (astrology, physiognomy, alchemy), which lost their scientific status and were relegated to the level of pseudo-sciences. A closer look into the redrawing of scientific boundaries to exclude the occult sciences and redefine other sciences will allow us to pose larger questions about scientific epistemologies.|Emin Lelic|[54994]|1|Undergraduate|SEM

Our primary texts come from popular culture, film, visual art, and literature, which have provided lightning rods for controversy and protest in this charged climate. This course investigates the fraught relationship between marginal expressions of gender and sexuality on the one hand, and society’s notions of security and safety on the other. Whose safety matters? How do women and other minorities use artistic production, within and alongside the realm of popular culture, to advocate for their own conceptions of safety and what it might mean? From the erotic performance of feminine agency found in soft-core pornographic pink films, to the slippage between fantasy and reality found in the staged violence of women’s pro-wrestling, to the eco-feminism of activist Ishimure Michiko, and beyond, this course will explore the state of gender, femininity, and sexual politics in Japan, from the 1960s on into the present day.|Marianne Tarcov|[53658]|1|Undergraduate|LEC

This course incorporates readings from history, anthropology and political science, and focuses on case studies from the entire continent from colonization in the late 19th century to the present. The course highlights numerous themes pertinent to the study of gender and sexuality, such as: (a) the intersections of, sexuality, race, class, and other identities; (b) gendered constructions of power and gendered power; (c) women’s “domestic” roles; and (d) the effects of migration, urbanization, and globalization on sex and sexuality.|Elizabeth Fretwell|[53831]|1|Undergraduate|SEM

Because one way to respond to this question looks disciplinary and methodological, this class will be structured around how “queer theory” (broadly defined) has been differently distributed and taken up by various fields of inquiry and, as such, will invite guest speakers from across the Social Sciences and Humanities to lead discussions on how their fields have encountered the materials, conversations, and questions raised by queer theory.|Omiela Hsu|[53848]|1|Undergraduate|SEM

We will consider the role of old Confucian hierarchies and scrutinize the links between industrialization, women's liberation, nationalism, and the communist movement.

Taking works by Charlotte and Emily Brontë, Charles Dickens, Henry Mayhew, Thomas Hardy, and Henry James as our principle points of departure, our course will pursue the “Victorian unconscious” through three lines of questioning: First, we will ask how Victorian literature anticipated the development of psychoanalytic concepts, such as the unconscious, repression, infantile sexuality and the symptom. At the same time, we will question whether Freud’s reflections on the psychopathologies of modern culture can in fact help to explain specific structural and social transformations in the 19th century public sphere, like the construction of modern sewer systems, the legal regulation of sexual acts, or the development of obscenity law. Finally, we will interrogate how the unconscious operates as a site of theoretical interest within Marxist and postcolonial critiques of modern imperialism. Our readings of 19th century novels will be complemented by extensive readings in psychoanalytic theory (Freud, Klein, Lacan, Winnicott) and pre-pscyhoanalytic psychiatry (e.g. Esquirol, Tuke, Krafft-Ebing, Charcot, Cotard), as well as relevant works by theorists elaborating and questioning psychoanalytic insights, including George Batailles, Michel Foucault, Jacques Rancière, Frederic Jameson, Edward Said, Kaja Silverman, Lauren Berlant, Eve Kosofsky Sed|Zachary Samalin|[55344]|1|Graduate|SEM

GRMN23715|Tue Thu : 03:30 PM-04:50 PM|Berlin in Fragments|[]|TBA|Open|Berlin at the turn of the 19th century was the epicenter of Germany’s rapid urbanization and industrialization, and as such it became a privileged site for observing and experiencing modernity. One of the most prominent features of life in the modern metropolis, as noted by contemporaries, was its fragmentary character, both in social terms—the atomization of society as a whole—and in mental terms—the psychic instability of the atomized individual. This course explores a variety of critical and artistic responses to fragmentation: critical efforts to render the fragmented urban landscape legible, and literary and other artistic efforts to explore the potentialities of fragmentation through innovative forms and techniques. The main part of the course will focus on the Weimar period: literature, film and criticism of the Golden Twenties. Afterwards we will turn to short fiction, poetry, and film of post-unification Berlin. Authors include Carl Sternheim, Walter Benjamin, Siegfried Kracauer, Joseph Roth, Alfred Döblin, Georg Heym, Jacob von Hoddis, Alfred Lichtenstein, Gottfried Benn, Bertolt Brecht, Durs Grünbein, and Tanja Dückers.

GRMN26715|Mon : 12:30 PM-03:20 PM|Anxiety|[]|TBA|Open|The phenomenon of anxiety emerged as one of the leading psychological disorders of the 20th and 21st centuries. Worrying ourselves into the realm of the pathological, we now have a requisite measure of anxiety for every prescribed stage of life. But why are we so anxious? Considering its prevalence in everyday life, the concept and theories of anxiety have been employed surprisingly seldom as a way into film, fiction, and art. In this course we examine the modern origin of contemporary discourses specific to anxiety and their unique manifestation in cultural artifacts. To understand the complex of anxiety in the so-called Western world, we rely on the theories of Søren Kierkegaard, Martin Heidegger, Sigmund Freud, Jacques Lacan, and Alenka Zupančič; fiction by Stoker, Schnitzler, Kafka, and Sebald; and film by Haneke, Kubrick, Ophuls, and Hitchcock. We will also have guest speakers from the fields of clinical psychiatry, geriatric medicine, philosophy, and comparative anthropology.|Anne Flannery, Malynne Sternstein|[41037]|1|Undergraduate|SEM

This course will focus on a number of medieval women writers, dealing mainly albeit not exclusively with vernacular texts. After a historical overview of the position of women in the early Middle Ages, the course will focus on Heloise and Hildegard of Bingen as transitional figures, and continue with four women writers writing in the vernacular, i.e., Mechtild of Magdeburg, Hadewijch, Marguerite Porete and Julian of Norwich. The course will link the spectrum of vernacular languages which they represent to the diversity of their individual positions and analyze that diversity in terms of ecclesiastical developments, gender division, authorial identity, and theological criticism.

HCHR51610|Mon : 06:00 PM-08:50 PM|Between East and West: Venice in the Pre-Modern Period|[]|Swift Hall 201|Open|Venice’s long-standing ties with the Byzantine Empire have left their visible trace in the city’s art and architecture and have had an equally strong impact on Venetian myth-making in the pre-modern period. Until today the appropriation of Byzantine style is especially evident in the church of Saint Mark the Evangelist, as well as in the decoration of less-well known medieval churches of the Venetian Lagoon. During the so-called Fourth Crusade, the Sack of Constantinople has led to large-scale pillaging of the Byzantine capital and the transfer to Venice of countless Byzantine artifacts, among them are liturgical items, reliquaries, icons, and architectural spoils. How were these artifacts employed in the Venetian Lagoon for religious and political ends after being disassociated from their original contexts? What transformations did they experience with regard to usage and appearance? What kinds of new ceremonies, both religious and secular, did they inspire? What was their impact on artistic creativity and religious life in their new environment? How were they perceived intellectually, and what kinds of narratives evolved around them in Venice over the centuries? These are some of the key questions to guide our research. On a broader scale, we will investigate various phenomena of cultural transfer and ‘hybridity’ from the Middle Ages to the Baroque era.|Karin Krause|[41405]|1|Graduate|SEM

Students will examine the theoretical and methodological groundings of cultural psychiatry, examining how scholars working in the phenomenological tradition have tried to describe the lived experiences of various forms of “psychopathology” or “madness.” By the end of the course, students will have learned how to describe and analyze the social dimension of a mental health experience, using a phenomenologically-grounded anthropological approach, and by adopting a technical vocabulary for understanding the lived experiences of mental illness (for instance, phenomena, life-world, being-in-the-world, intentionality, epoché, embodiment, madness, psychopathology, melancholia/depression, schizophrenia, etc). In addition, given the ongoing problematic of “how to represent mental illness,” students will also have the opportunity to think through the different ways of presenting their analysis, both in the form of weekly blog entries and during a final-week mock-workshop, where they will showcase their work in a creative medium appropriate to that analysis.|Francis McKay|[53675]|1|Undergraduate|SEM

First, science has been the subject of artistic representation, in painting and photography, in poetry and novels (e.g., in Byron’s poetry, for example). Second, science has been used to explain aesthetic effects (e.g., Helmholtz’s work on the way painters achieve visual effects or musicians achieve tonal effects). Third, aesthetic means have been used to convey scientific conceptions (e.g., through illustrations in scientific volumes or through aesthetically affective and effective writing). Finally, philosophers have stepped back to consider the relationship between scientific knowing and aesthetic comprehension (e.g., Kant, Bas van Fraassen); much of the discussion of this latter will focus on the relation between images and what they represent. In this lecture-discussion course we will consider all of these aspects of the science-aesthetic connection.|Robert Richards|[42920]|1|Undergraduate|SEM

Historians have often relegated Iberia and its New World domains from accounts of the developments of modern science. They have traditionally claimed that strict censorship and a commitment to orthodox Catholicism prevented Spain, once the most powerful empire of the world, from embarking on the path towards scientific modernity in the eighteenth century. Modern scholars, however, have challenged this narrative by embracing more inclusive concepts of ""science"" to explain the many ways in which early modern people related to nature. Some of these practices include the writing of natural histories, botanical research, and linguistic studies, all fields that Iberian scholars pioneered in their efforts to govern their vast domains.

HIST10102|Mon Wed : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM|Intro To African Civ-2|[]|Rosenwald Hall 329|Open|The second segment of the African Civilizations sequence uses anthropological perspectives to investigate colonial and postcolonial encounters in West and East Africa. The course objective is to show that while colonialism was brutal and oppressive, it was by no means a unidirectional process of domination in which Europeans plundered the African continent and enforced a wholesale adoption of European culture. Rather, scholars today recognize that colonial encounters were complex culture, political, and economic fields of interaction. Africans actively adopted, reworked, and contested colonizers' policies and projects, and Europeans drew heavily from these encounters to form liberal conceptions of self, nation, and society. Over the course of the quarter, students will learn about forms of personhood, political economy, and everyday life in the twentieth century. Course themes will include social reproduction, kinship practices, medicine, domesticity, and development. Note(s): Taking these courses in sequence is recommended but not required; this sequence meets the general education requirement in civilization studies. CHDV Distribution C*.

As we examine the variety of their experiences, we will often call into question what we mean in the first place by “Europe” and “civilization.” Rather than providing a narrative of high politics, the sequence will emphasize the contested geographic, religious, social, and racial boundaries that have defined and redefined Europe and its people over the centuries. We will read and discuss sources covering the period from the early Middle Ages to the present, from a variety of genres: saga, biography, personal letters, property records, political treatises, memoirs, and government documents, to name only a few. Individual instructors may choose different sources and highlight different aspects of European civilization, but some of the most important readings will be the same in all sections. The two-quarter sequence may also be supplemented by a third quarter, in which students will have the opportunity to explore in greater depth a particular topic in the history of European civilization.

Yet science continues to pose questions that are challenging and, in some instances, troubling. How will our technologies affect the environment? Should we prevent the cloning of humans? Can we devise a politically acceptable framework for the patenting of life? Such questions make it vitally important that we try to understand what science is and how it works, even if we never enter labs.

We then consider imperial debates over taxation in the 1760s and 1770s, returning Benjamin Franklin’s Autobiography to its original context. Reading Paine’s Common Sense and the letters of Abigail Adams and John Adams we look at the multiple meanings of independence. We study Jefferson’s drafting process, read the Declaration over the shoulders of people on both sides of the Atlantic, and consider clues to contemporary meanings beyond the intentions of Congress. Finally, we briefly engage the post-revolutionary history of the place and meaning of the Declaration in American life. (F)|Eric Slauter|[43739]|1|Undergraduate|SEM

In this course, we tackle these questions through an investigation of some the major scandals of the early modern and modern periods in both Europe and the Middle East. From courtroom dramas in Paris and London to fierce debates in coffee houses and newspapers in Cairo, Beirut, and Istanbul, this course offers a comparative view of how scandals were disseminated, received, and narrativized across time and space.

What determined the architectural form of synagogues? Making extensive use of Jewish law and customary practice, cookbooks, etiquette guides, prints, films, novels, maps, memoirs, architectural drawings and photographs, and tourist guides, this course will analyze how Jews (in all their diversity) and non-Jews defined Jewish spaces and places. The focus will be on Europe in the 19th and 20th centuries, but we will also venture back into the early modern period and across the Mediterranean to Palestine/Israel and North Africa, and across the Atlantic to the Caribbean and the Americas. We will study both actually existing structures—synagogues, ritual baths, schools, kosher (and kosher-style) butcher shops, bakeries and restaurants, social and political clubs, hospitals, orphanages, old age homes, museums, and memorials—but also texts and visual culture in which Jewish places and spaces are imagined or vilified. Parallel to our work with primary sources we will read in the recent, very rich, scholarly literature on this topic. This is not a survey course; we will undertake a series of intensive case-studies through which we will address the larger issues.

HIST24005|Mon Wed : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM|The Burden of History: The Nation and Its Lost Paradise|[]|Foster Hall 408|Open|How and why do national identities provoke the deep emotional attachments that they do? In this course we try to understand these emotional attachments by examining the narrative of loss and redemption through which most nations in the Balkans retell their Ottoman past. We begin by considering the mythic temporality of the Romantic national narrative while focusing on specific national literary texts where the national past is retold through the formula of original wholeness, foreign invasion, Passion, and Salvation. We then proceed to unpack the structural role of the different elements of that narrative. With the help of Žižek’s theory of the subject as constituted by trauma, we think about the national fixation on the trauma of loss, and the role of trauma in the formation of national consciousness. Specific theme inquiries involve the figure of the Janissary as self and other, brotherhood and fratricide, and the writing of the national trauma on the individual physical body. Special attention is given to the general aesthetic of victimhood, the casting of the victimized national self as the object of the “other’s perverse desire.” With the help of Freud, Žižek, and Kant we consider the transformation of national victimhood into the sublimity of the national self. The main primary texts include Petar Njegoš’ Mountain Wreath (Serbia and Montenegro), Ismail Kadare’s The Castle (Albania), Anton Donchev’s Time of Parting (Bulgaria).|Angelina Ilieva|[42376]|1|Undergraduate|LEC
HIST24510|Tue Thu : 03:00 PM-04:20 PM|Gender and Sexuality in Modern China|[]|TBA|Closed|"This course explores changing ideas about gender and sexuality in modern China. ""Modern"" in the context of this course signifies a period in which China faced radical new paradigms for the role of sex and the meaning of gender. Although much that we will read describes the twentieth century, we will also discover that innovations in gender roles are not unique to the past hundred years. Nor, despite long-standing stereotypes to the contrary, has it only been the privilege of the elites to disrupt the traditional male-female binary. Readings will address such themes as the ways in which gender defines patterns in family life, in politics and under the law; marriage and homosexuality; prostitution and trafficking; performance and cross dressing; the implementation of the one child policy; gender roles in minority communities; and China's handling of HIV/AIDS. We will consider the role of old Confucian hierarchies and scrutinize the links between industrialization, women's liberation, nationalism, and the communist movement. Through these diverse topics, this seminar aims to expand students' conception of the areas in which gender plays a relevant and influential role."|Johanna Ransmeier|[42902]|1|Undergraduate|SEM

With a slight emphasis on the natural sciences--but broadening out our view when necessary--we will examine how German scientists chose to interact with six (or seven, depending on how you count) Germanys--the German Empire (1871-1918), the Weimar Republic (1919-1933), the Third Reich (1933-1945), occupied Germany (1945-1949), West and East Germany (1949-1990), and the reunified Germany of today (1990-present). How did these scientists build relationships with the various governments? What were their reactions to the various forms of government (i.e. democracy vs. fascist dictatorship vs. 'real existing socialism')? How did emerging concepts of ethics in science play into scientists' relations with the political sphere? Why the constant claims of science as 'apolitical'?|Ryan Dahn|[42454]|1|Undergraduate|SEM

HIST25506|Tue : 12:00 PM-02:50 PM|Science and Aesthetics in the 18th-21st Centuries|[]|TBA|Open|One can distinguish four ways in which science and aesthetics are related during the period since the Renaissance. First, science has been the subject of artistic representation, in painting and photography, in poetry and novels (e.g., in Byron’s poetry, for example). Second, science has been used to explain aesthetic effects (e.g., Helmholtz’s work on the way painters achieve visual effects or musicians achieve tonal effects). Third, aesthetic means have been used to convey scientific conceptions (e.g., through illustrations in scientific volumes or through aesthetically affective and effective writing). Finally, philosophers have stepped back to consider the relationship between scientific knowing and aesthetic comprehension (e.g., Kant, Bas van Fraassen); much of the discussion of this latter will focus on the relation between images and what they represent. In this lecture-discussion course we will consider all of these aspects of the science-aesthetic connection.|Robert Richards|[42918]|1|Undergraduate|SEM

HIST26117|Tue Thu : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM|Progress and Development in Latin America|[]|Psychology K114|Open|“Progress,” and its derived concept of “development” have puzzled Latin Americans throughout their modern history: they were an ambitious goal and a challenge for intellectual and political elites, a reality and an elusive dream for ordinary Latin Americans, and the cause of new challenges and problems wherever they actually or presumably took place. For historians, progress and development used to represent the very sense of universal history, a narrative that sneaked into visions of “Western modernity” and “globalization.” But later on, they became a myth to debunk rather than an object of reflection. What has “progress” meant particularly for Latin Americans? What is, for instance, the meaning of “progress” in the Brazilian flag? How did those notions shape the one of “development” since WWII? In political terms, what ideas of “progress” and “development” animated oligarchic, liberal, populist, military, revolutionary, and democratic projects across the region? Because both concepts involve planning and envisioning the outcome of present actions, the history of progress and development is also, in a certain way, a history of the future. The goal of this seminar is to help students situate a problem of their choice and trace its history in terms of the political debates that pursued the goal of progress and development in that specific realm.|Pablo Palomino|[41613]|1|Undergraduate|LEC

Historians have often relegated Iberia and its New World domains from accounts of the developments of modern science. They have traditionally claimed that strict censorship and a commitment to orthodox Catholicism prevented Spain, once the most powerful empire of the world, from embarking on the path towards scientific modernity in the eighteenth century. Modern scholars, however, have challenged this narrative by embracing more inclusive concepts of ""science"" to explain the many ways in which early modern people related to nature. Some of these practices include the writing of natural histories, botanical research, and linguistic studies, all fields that Iberian scholars pioneered in their efforts to govern their vast domains. This course will introduce students to a diversity of scientific practices that flourished in the Hispanic world between 1400 and 1800."|Valeria Lopez Fadul|[42927]|1|Undergraduate|SEM

HIST26126|Mon Wed : 04:30 PM-05:50 PM|The Rise and Fall of the Spanish Empire|[]|TBA|Open|"In the span of three centuries the country we now recognize as Spain went from being a collection of kingdoms in the war-torn Iberian Peninsula of the fifteenth century to a global empire in the sixteenth, to an empire on the verge of collapse in the seventeenth, and finally to a revitalized empire in the eighteenth century. This course will examine this three-hundred-year history by investigating the following essential questions: (1) How did a collection of diverse kingdoms manage to create a global empire? (2) What specific factors can explain the Spanish decline of the seventeenth century? (3) Was the Spanish Empire doomed to fail from the very beginning? (4) Why did many colonial subjects remain loyal to Spain after the Conquest and especially after a century of decline? (5) Why did the empire collapse only after 1808? In our exploration of these questions, we will pay particular attention to Spain's ambitious and pioneering, if also destructive, involvement with conquest, colonial exploitation, chattel slavery, racial domination, and a mission to ""civilize"" the world. We will then proceed to investigate the Spanish decline of the seventeenth century and the influence of the emerging empires of Britain, France, and the Dutch Republic. The course concludes by examining Spain's effort to reform its empire during the eighteenth century, interrogating whether this effort alienated Spanish colonial subjects and ultimately contributed to the dissolution of the empire."|Fidel Tavarez|[42930]|1|Undergraduate|SEM

HIST29907|Tue Thu : 04:30 PM-05:50 PM|The Intelligentsia:  On Slavic Social Thought|[]|TBA|Open|Isaiah Berlin described the notion of the Intelligentsia as “arguably Russia’s greatest contribution to world civilization.” But just how culturally specific—or, alternatively, universal—is that concept? Many of the chief theoretical concerns of the Intelligentsia (the role of the public intellectual in society, the expression of dissidence and the ethics of exile) have preoccupied thinkers since Socrates. What distinguishes the Intelligentsia from other models of public intellectualism? How have various Slavic public intellectuals maintained, or broken with, this tradition? In order to establish a theoretical vocabulary, the course will begin with an introduction to several classical and contemporary theories of the role of the intellectual in society. We will then ground our inquiry in the historical invention of the Russian Intelligentsia during the mid-19th Century before setting off to analyze its 20th and 21st-century manifestations. Throughout the course, our main goal will be to examine the ways in which these thinkers conceive of and perform the role of a “public intellectual.” How do they balance the tasks of documenting and participating in the historical events they describe? What strategies do they utilize in order to relay their intellectual activity to a larger public? What do they consider to be the responsibility of intellectuals?|Kaitlyn Tucker|[54336]|1|Undergraduate|LEC

HIST34005|Mon Wed : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM|The Burden of History: The Nation and Its Lost Paradise|[]|Foster Hall 408|Open|How and why do national identities provoke the deep emotional attachments that they do? In this course we try to understand these emotional attachments by examining the narrative of loss and redemption through which most nations in the Balkans retell their Ottoman past. We begin by considering the mythic temporality of the Romantic national narrative while focusing on specific national literary texts where the national past is retold through the formula of original wholeness, foreign invasion, Passion, and Salvation. We then proceed to unpack the structural role of the different elements of that narrative. With the help of Žižek’s theory of the subject as constituted by trauma, we think about the national fixation on the trauma of loss, and the role of trauma in the formation of national consciousness. Specific theme inquiries involve the figure of the Janissary as self and other, brotherhood and fratricide, and the writing of the national trauma on the individual physical body. Special attention is given to the general aesthetic of victimhood, the casting of the victimized national self as the object of the “other’s perverse desire.” With the help of Freud, Žižek, and Kant we consider the transformation of national victimhood into the sublimity of the national self. The main primary texts include Petar Njegoš’ Mountain Wreath (Serbia and Montenegro), Ismail Kadare’s The Castle (Albania), Anton Donchev’s Time of Parting (Bulgaria).|Angelina Ilieva|[42377]|1|Graduate|LEC
HIST34510|Tue Thu : 03:00 PM-04:20 PM|Gender and Sexuality in Modern China|[]|TBA|Closed|"This course explores changing ideas about gender and sexuality in modern China. ""Modern"" in the context of this course signifies a period in which China faced radical new paradigms for the role of sex and the meaning of gender. Although much that we will read describes the twentieth century, we will also discover that innovations in gender roles are not unique to the past hundred years. Nor, despite long-standing stereotypes to the contrary, has it only been the privilege of the elites to disrupt the traditional male-female binary. Readings will address such themes as the ways in which gender defines patterns in family life, in politics and under the law; marriage and homosexuality; prostitution and trafficking; performance and cross dressing; the implementation of the one child policy; gender roles in minority communities; and China's handling of HIV/AIDS. We will consider the role of old Confucian hierarchies and scrutinize the links between industrialization, women's liberation, nationalism, and the communist movement. Through these diverse topics, this seminar aims to expand students' conception of the areas in which gender plays a relevant and influential role."|Johanna Ransmeier|[42907]|1|Graduate|SEM

HIST35506|Tue : 12:00 PM-02:50 PM|Science and Aesthetics in the 18th-21st Centuries|[]|TBA|Open|One can distinguish four ways in which science and aesthetics are related during the period since the Renaissance. First, science has been the subject of artistic representation, in painting and photography, in poetry and novels (e.g., in Byron’s poetry, for example). Second, science has been used to explain aesthetic effects (e.g., Helmholtz’s work on the way painters achieve visual effects or musicians achieve tonal effects). Third, aesthetic means have been used to convey scientific conceptions (e.g., through illustrations in scientific volumes or through aesthetically affective and effective writing). Finally, philosophers have stepped back to consider the relationship between scientific knowing and aesthetic comprehension (e.g., Kant, Bas van Fraassen); much of the discussion of this latter will focus on the relation between images and what they represent. In this lecture-discussion course we will consider all of these aspects of the science-aesthetic connection.|Robert Richards|[42921]|1|Graduate|SEM

HIST60909|Tue : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|Late Medieval Women: Authorship and Authority|[]|Swift Hall 208|Open|In recent decades there has been a great deal of interest in medieval vernacular theology, as complementing the more traditional division of medieval theological texts into monastic and scholastic. This course will focus on a number of medieval women writers, dealing mainly albeit not exclusively with vernacular texts. After a historical overview of the position of women in the early Middle Ages, the course will focus on Heloise and Hildegard of Bingen as transitional figures, and continue with four women writers writing in the vernacular, i.e., Mechtild of Magdeburg, Hadewijch, Marguerite Porete and Julian of Norwich. The course will link the spectrum of vernacular languages which they represent to the diversity of their individual positions and analyze that diversity in terms of ecclesiastical developments, gender division, authorial identity, and theological criticism. The final aim is to come to an assessment of the constructive contribution of these vernacular treatises to the tradition of late medieval theology and spirituality|Willemien Otten|[41262]|1|Graduate|LEC

In this course we will explore the significance of what Raymond Williams called the ""cultural revolution"" for the lives of ordinary men and women in the United States. This history encompasses subjects that have retained their relevance in contemporary life, including racial and ethnic stereotypes, armchair travel, virtual versus lived reality, authenticity and artifice, mass entertainment, city life, celebrity, and gender. Readings will include a series of theoretical works in combination with articles and monographs, to provide a broader underpinning for the problems of perception and historical analysis at play in this realm of scholarly thought and practice."|Amy Lippert|[54214]|1|Graduate|SEM

We will focus on the role of women in the movement, the ideological alliances in its founding, and the roles of particular conservative groups in the movement's history.

HIST64202|Wed : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|The Discovery of Paganism|[]|Regenstein Library 207|Open|"How do we know what we know about ancient religions? Historians of religion often begin by turning to texts: either sacred texts, or, in the absence of such scriptures, descriptions of belief and practice by observers from outside the faith. Archaeologists focus their attention on the spaces and traces of religious practice—or at least those that survive—while art historians begin by examining images of deities and religious rites. Yet we often fail to see the extent to which the questions which we ask of all of these diverse sources are conditioned by Christian rhetoric about pagan worship. In this course, we compare two moments when Christians encountered ""pagans"": during the initial Christian construction of a discourse on paganism (and, more broadly, a discourse on religion) during the late Roman empire and during the Spanish discovery of the New World. Our course examines silences and absences in the textual and material records, as well as the divergences between texts and objects, in order to further our understanding of ancient religious practice. We will begin to see the many ways in which, as scholars of religion, we are in effect still Christian theologians, paving the way for new approaches to the study of ancient religion."|Clifford Ando, Claudia Brittenham|[43843]|1|Graduate|SEM

We begin with a consideration of the English Revolution, investigating the texts of the Declaration of Rights of 1689 and Locke’s Second Treatise and their meanings to American revolutionaries. We then consider imperial debates over taxation in the 1760s and 1770s, returning Benjamin Franklin’s Autobiography to its original context. Reading Paine’s Common Sense and the letters of Abigail Adams and John Adams we look at the multiple meanings of independence. We study Jefferson’s drafting process, read the Declaration over the shoulders of people on both sides of the Atlantic, and consider clues to contemporary meanings beyond the intentions of Congress. Finally, we briefly engage the post-revolutionary history of the place and meaning of the Declaration in American life. (F)|Eric Slauter|[43740]|1|Undergraduate|SEM

We will spend the first half of the course exploring the implementation and evaluation of the programs that make up the traditional safety net for poor Americans: income supports, health insurance, and housing assistance. We will spend the rest of the quarter exploring topics that complicate the traditional social policy regime, including how the safety net is more robust for some groups, such as the elderly and veterans, than others. We will explore how the legal systems of immigration and incarceration hamper anti-poverty policy and how safety net programs address the needs of rural and Native Americans.

While wisdom has received less scholarly attention in modern times, it has recently re-emerged in popular discourse with a growing recognition of its potential importance for addressing complex issues in many domains. But what is wisdom? It’s often used with a meaning more akin to ""smart"" or ""clever."" Is it just vast knowledge? This course will examine the nature of wisdom—how it has been defined, how its meaning has changed, and what its essential components might be. We will examine how current psychological theories conceptualize wisdom and consider whether, and how, wisdom can be studied scientifically; that is, can wisdom be measured and experimentally manipulated to illuminate its underlying mechanisms and understand its functions? Finally, we will explore how concepts of wisdom can be applied in business, education, medicine, the law, and in the course of our everyday lives.

INRE44802|Mon : 09:30 AM-12:20 PM|Network Theory for International Political Economy|[]|Saieh Hall for Economics 242|Open|This course introduces students to the ongoing network turn in international political economy (IPE). It has three goals. First, students will replace purely metaphorical (and vague) talk of networks with focused propositions about the network properties and dynamics of contemporary phenomena such as international hierarchy, regional fragmentation amidst global integration, and the fate of sovereign territoriality in an age of (violent) transnational activism. Second, students will ponder competing explanations of the network turn in IPE: have IPE scholars abandoned conventional analytical tools in favor of network theory, because the conventional toolkit already came with rudimentary network-theoretic devices that simply needed sharpening; or did some changes in the real international economy prompt the shift? Finally, students will critically assess the ability of SNT to be a vehicle for innovative social science. They will do this, in part, by devising a research proposal of their own that assesses the validity and utility of testing a single network-theoretic proposition against some conventional competitor.|Matthias Staisch|[41845]|1|Graduate|SEM

ISLM43301|Thu : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|Comparative Mystical Literature:  Islamic, Jewish and Christian|[]|Swift Hall MEM LIB|Open|The mysticisms of the three monotheistic faiths share many features that invite comparison. All three deal with sacred texts that overlap in instances, and all three responded in different ways to the philosophical mysticisms inherited from Classical antiquity. While there are a number of influences, both direct and indirect, among these traditions, there are far more instances of similar structural motifs shared by the three. This course is designed to explore the history and structural dynamics of Jewish, Christian, and Islamic mysticisms through the careful reading of primary sources across the traditions. The Class will be limited to 20 students on a first-come, first-serve basis. Each student will be expected to demonstrate reading competence in the language of one of the mystical traditions (e. g., Hebrew, Arabic, Persian, Latin, or one of the Christian vernaculars).|Michael Fishbane, Michael Sells|[54867]|1|Graduate|SEM

ITAL23502|Mon : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|Boccaccio's Decameron|[]|TBA|Open|One of the most important and influential works of the middle ages—and a lot funnier than the Divine Comedy. Boccaccio’s Decameron, written in the midst of the social disruption caused by the Black Death (1348), may have held readers attention for centuries because of its bawdiness, but it is also a profound exploration into the basis of faith and the meaning of death, the status of language, the construction of social hierarchy and social order, and the nature of crisis and historical change. Framed by a story telling contest between seven young ladies and three young men who have left the city to avoid the plague, the one hundred stories of the Decameron form a structural masterpiece that anticipates Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales, the Renaissance epics, and the modern short story. We will especially focus on how the work explores the intersection of legal and literary representation but students will be encouraged to further explore in individual projects the many topics raised by the text, including (and in addition to the themes mentioned above) magic, the visual arts, mercantile culture, travel and discovery, and new religious practices.|Justin Steinberg|[54800]|1|Undergraduate|SEM

What determined the architectural form of synagogues? Making extensive use of Jewish law and customary practice, cookbooks, etiquette guides, prints, films, novels, maps, memoirs, architectural drawings and photographs, and tourist guides, this course will analyze how Jews (in all their diversity) and non-Jews defined Jewish spaces and places. The focus will be on Europe in the 19th and 20th centuries, but we will also venture back into the early modern period and across the Mediterranean to Palestine/Israel and North Africa, and across the Atlantic to the Caribbean and the Americas. We will study both actually existing structures—synagogues, ritual baths, schools, kosher (and kosher-style) butcher shops, bakeries and restaurants, social and political clubs, hospitals, orphanages, old age homes, museums, and memorials—but also texts and visual culture in which Jewish places and spaces are imagined or vilified. Parallel to our work with primary sources we will read in the recent, very rich, scholarly literature on this topic. This is not a survey course; we will undertake a series of intensive case-studies through which we will address the larger issues.

First, science has been the subject of artistic representation, in painting and photography, in poetry and novels (e.g., in Byron’s poetry, for example). Second, science has been used to explain aesthetic effects (e.g., Helmholtz’s work on the way painters achieve visual effects or musicians achieve tonal effects). Third, aesthetic means have been used to convey scientific conceptions (e.g., through illustrations in scientific volumes or through aesthetically affective and effective writing). Finally, philosophers have stepped back to consider the relationship between scientific knowing and aesthetic comprehension (e.g., Kant, Bas van Fraassen); much of the discussion of this latter will focus on the relation between images and what they represent.

KNOW40301|Wed : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|The Discovery of Paganism|[]|Regenstein Library 207|Open|"How do we know what we know about ancient religions? Historians of religion often begin by turning to texts: either sacred texts, or, in the absence of such scriptures, descriptions of belief and practice by observers from outside the faith. Archaeologists focus their attention on the spaces and traces of religious practice—or at least those that survive—while art historians begin by examining images of deities and religious rites. Yet we often fail to see the extent to which the questions which we ask of all of these diverse sources are conditioned by Christian rhetoric about pagan worship. In this course, we compare two moments when Christians encountered ""pagans"": during the initial Christian construction of a discourse on paganism (and, more broadly, a discourse on religion) during the late Roman empire and during the Spanish discovery of the New World. Our course examines silences and absences in the textual and material records, as well as the divergences between texts and objects, in order to further our understanding of ancient religious practice. We will begin to see the many ways in which, as scholars of religion, we are in effect still Christian theologians, paving the way for new approaches to the study of ancient religion."|Clifford Ando, Claudia Brittenham|[43845]|1|Graduate|SEM

The New Latin American Cinema (NLAC) of the late 1950s-70s generated unprecedented international enthusiasm for Latin American film production. The filmmakers of this loosely designated movement were defining themselves in relation to global realist film traditions like Italian Neorealism and Griersonian documentary, in relation to--mostly failed-- experiments in building Hollywood-style national film industries, and in relation to regional discourses of underdevelopment and mestizaje. Since the late 1990s, a reassessment of the legacy of the NLAC has been taking shape as scholars have begun to interrogate its canonical status in the face of a changed political climate. In the sphere of filmmaking, contemporary Latin American new wave cinemas are also grappling with that legacy-sometimes disavowing it, sometimes appropriating it. We will situate the NLAC in its historical context, survey its formal achievements and political aspirations, assess its legacy, and take stock of the ways and the reasons that it haunts contemporary production.|Salome Skvirsky|[54787]|1|Undergraduate|SEM

We will situate creoles in the context of the plantation settlement colonies that produced them and compare their emergence specifically with that of languages such as English and the Romance languages in Europe. We will also compare these evolutions with those of new colonial varieties of European languages (such as Amish English, mainstream American English varieties, Brazilian Portuguese, and Québécois French) which emerged around the same time but are not considered creoles. Using the comparative approach (in evolutionary theory), we will assess whether the criteria used in the genetic classification of languages have been applied uniformly to creole and non-creole languages.

LACS26112|Mon Wed : 04:30 PM-05:50 PM|The Rise and Fall of the Spanish Empire|[]|TBA|Open|"In the span of three centuries the country we now recognize as Spain went from being a collection of kingdoms in the war-torn Iberian Peninsula of the fifteenth century to a global empire in the sixteenth, to an empire on the verge of collapse in the seventeenth, and finally to a revitalized empire in the eighteenth century. This course will examine this three-hundred-year history by investigating the following essential questions: (1) How did a collection of diverse kingdoms manage to create a global empire? (2) What specific factors can explain the Spanish decline of the seventeenth century? (3) Was the Spanish Empire doomed to fail from the very beginning? (4) Why did many colonial subjects remain loyal to Spain after the Conquest and especially after a century of decline? (5) Why did the empire collapse only after 1808? In our exploration of these questions, we will pay particular attention to Spain's ambitious and pioneering, if also destructive, involvement with conquest, colonial exploitation, chattel slavery, racial domination, and a mission to ""civilize"" the world. We will then proceed to investigate the Spanish decline of the seventeenth century and the influence of the emerging empires of Britain, France, and the Dutch Republic. The course concludes by examining Spain's effort to reform its empire during the eighteenth century, interrogating whether this effort alienated Spanish colonial subjects and ultimately contributed to the dissolution of the empire."|Fidel Tavarez|[42931]|1|Undergraduate|SEM

Historians have often relegated Iberia and its New World domains from accounts of the developments of modern science. They have traditionally claimed that strict censorship and a commitment to orthodox Catholicism prevented Spain, once the most powerful empire of the world, from embarking on the path towards scientific modernity in the eighteenth century. Modern scholars, however, have challenged this narrative by embracing more inclusive concepts of ""science"" to explain the many ways in which early modern people related to nature. Some of these practices include the writing of natural histories, botanical research, and linguistic studies, all fields that Iberian scholars pioneered in their efforts to govern their vast domains. This course will introduce students to a diversity of scientific practices that flourished in the Hispanic world between 1400 and 1800."|Valeria Lopez Fadul|[42929]|1|Undergraduate|SEM

LACS26413|Tue Thu : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM|Progress and Development in Latin America|[]|Psychology K114|Open|“Progress,” and its derived concept of “development” have puzzled Latin Americans throughout their modern history: they were an ambitious goal and a challenge for intellectual and political elites, a reality and an elusive dream for ordinary Latin Americans, and the cause of new challenges and problems wherever they actually or presumably took place. For historians, progress and development used to represent the very sense of universal history, a narrative that sneaked into visions of “Western modernity” and “globalization.” But later on, they became a myth to debunk rather than an object of reflection. What has “progress” meant particularly for Latin Americans? What is, for instance, the meaning of “progress” in the Brazilian flag? How did those notions shape the one of “development” since WWII? In political terms, what ideas of “progress” and “development” animated oligarchic, liberal, populist, military, revolutionary, and democratic projects across the region? Because both concepts involve planning and envisioning the outcome of present actions, the history of progress and development is also, in a certain way, a history of the future. The goal of this seminar is to help students situate a problem of their choice and trace its history in terms of the political debates that pursued the goal of progress and development in that specific realm.|Pablo Palomino|[41611]|1|Undergraduate|LEC

In most democracies, the distribution of wealth among citizens is unequal but the right to vote is universal. Why then have so many newly democratic states transitioned under conditions of high inequality yet failed to redistribute? This course explores this puzzle by analyzing the mechanisms through which individual and group preferences can be translated into pro-poor policies, and the role elites play in influencing a government's capacity or incentives to redistribute wealth. Topics include economic inequality and the demand for redistribution, the difference in redistribution between democracy and dictatorship, the role of globalization in policymaking, and the effects of redistribution on political stability and change.|Michael Albertus|[41785]|1|Undergraduate|SEM

LACS40301|Wed : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|The Discovery of Paganism|[]|Regenstein Library 207|Open|"How do we know what we know about ancient religions? Historians of religion often begin by turning to texts: either sacred texts, or, in the absence of such scriptures, descriptions of belief and practice by observers from outside the faith. Archaeologists focus their attention on the spaces and traces of religious practice—or at least those that survive—while art historians begin by examining images of deities and religious rites. Yet we often fail to see the extent to which the questions which we ask of all of these diverse sources are conditioned by Christian rhetoric about pagan worship. In this course, we compare two moments when Christians encountered ""pagans"": during the initial Christian construction of a discourse on paganism (and, more broadly, a discourse on religion) during the late Roman empire and during the Spanish discovery of the New World. Our course examines silences and absences in the textual and material records, as well as the divergences between texts and objects, in order to further our understanding of ancient religious practice.

This graduate seminar will introduce students to fundamental questions in the study of political regimes: What distinguishes democracy from dictatorship? How does the functioning of democratic institutions affect democratic survival? Why are some dictatorships more stable than others, and what role do institutions such as legislatures, parties, and elections play in their stability? What political and economic factors explain regime transitions, and why do transitions tend to cluster both spatially and temporally? The course will examine how these questions are addressed in current scholarship, with an emphasis on enabling students to design research projects that contribute to our understanding of how political regimes function, persist, and change.

This graduate seminar will introduce students to the scholarly literature on redistribution, focusing primarily on recent work. We will study the causes and consequences of redistribution, focusing both on the institutions that shape incentives for governments to implement redistribution, as well as the mechanisms, actors, and international conditions that can erode government incentives or capabilities to redistribute. The emphasis of the course will be twofold: rigorously examining the inferences we can draw from existing work, and designing research that can contribute to a better understanding of the fundamental questions regarding redistributive policies.

LAWS42501|Mon Wed Thu : 09:45 AM-10:50 AM|Corporate Finance|[]|Laird Bell Quadrangle F|Closed|(BID, CORE) This course provides an overview of the application to law of the basic principles of corporate finance and financial economics. Topics include the concept of discounting and present value, portfolio theory and diversification, the theory of efficient capital markets and its applications in securities litigation, corporate capital structure and bond covenants, and the analysis of options and other derivative instruments. The principles and concepts of corporate finance are essential to understanding modern corporate transactions. Increasingly, lawyers must understand these principles in order to structure transactions in ways that achieve particular business objectives. The concepts in this class are also of great value to lawyers outside the corporate area: financial principles can be fruitfully applied to a wide variety of legal questions, ranging from estate planning to the calculation of tort awards. This class assumes no background in finance, and is aimed primarily at students with little or no prior exposure to the field (rather than those with an MBA or with an undergraduate finance major). It does not use any mathematics beyond basic arithmetic and some simple algebra.|Dhammika Dharmapala|[40596]|1|Law School|CRS
LAWS42603|Mon : 08:30 AM-11:40 AM|Corporate and Entrepreneurial Finance|[]|Laird Bell Quadrangle D|Closed|"(++, BID, CORE, DOC) This course uses the case method to study the practical aspects of important topics in corporate and entrepreneurial finance. We will apply the concepts and techniques of corporate finance to actual situations. The course is roughly divided into three sections: (1) financing decisions; (2) investment decisions; (3) entrepreneurial finance; and (4) private equity finance. In addition to analyzing the specific financing problems or issues, we will consider how those issues relate to the strategic objectives of the firm. It will be important to examine the ""big picture"" assumptions that are used in the numerical calculations. This course also places a strong emphasis on presentation and discussion skills. It will be important to explain your positions or arguments to each other and to try to argue for the implementation of your recommendations. COURSE PROCEDURES For each class meeting, I will assign study questions concerning one or two case studies. For most of the class period, we will consider the questions and the material in the cases. This includes the first meeting. You are allowed and encouraged, but not required to meet in groups outside of class to discuss and analyze the cases. Each group will submit a two-page memorandum of analysis and recommendations at the beginning of each case discussion. If you are working in a group, I will accept one memorandum from the group and count it for all students in the group. If you choose to do this, the group can include up to 3 students. Each memorandum should be typed and double-spaced. Write these as if you were writing a recommendation to the CEO or major decision maker in the case. The two page limit is for text only. You may attach as many numerical calculations as you wish. Memoranda will not be accepted after the class has met. A memorandum will be given credit if it is handed in and no credit if it is not. Initially, therefore, I will not grade them. However, I will use the memoranda to determine final grades for those students who are on the border of two grades. You should prepare a memorandum for UST, the first class. The readings and articles that I have assigned and will hand out are largely non-technical in nature and summarize the findings of academic research in corporate finance in the recent past. These articles are meant to be background material that will help you analyze the cases. They should not necessarily be cited in the case discussion. You should argue as if you were in a corporate boardroom rather than in a doctoral seminar. The process of arriving at the answer is as important as getting the answer. Because of the nature of this course (and its grading criteria), it is extremely important that you attend every class, arrive on time and be prepared to participate. To help me out, you should bring your name cards to each class. I may not remember who said what without those cards. In the past, students have asked me to hand out my case analysis after the class has discussed the case. I will not do this, because there are usually no absolute right answers. The best cases are deliberately written to be ambiguous. While there are no right answers, there are good arguments and bad arguments. This course is designed to help you learn to distinguish between sensible and senseless arguments. Handing out my analyses would reduce the ambiguity in the cases and partially defeat the purpose of doing cases. If you are uncomfortable with ambiguity, this class may not be for you. PREREQUISITE Students should have an understanding of financial statements. I.e., students should be able to read an income statement, cash flow statement and balance sheet."|Steven Neil Kaplan|[40595]|1|Law School|CRS
LAWS42801|Mon Wed Thu : 01:30 PM-02:35 PM|Antitrust Law|[]|Laird Bell Quadrangle I|Closed|(BID, CORE) This course is a one-quarter survey of antitrust law. It is designed for students with diverse interests and practice plans. The course should be as valuable to the general business lawyer and the legally trained private equity investor or investment banker as it is to the litigator. There is no assumption of advanced skill or training in economics and no complex mathematical or economic tools are required. Antitrust has been defined not by rulemaking and statutory expansion, but by judges deciding cases, one at a time, in the common law tradition, in large part because the antitrust statutes are very terse and compact (unlike statues in other business fields such as securities regulation, banking regulation and the regulation of telecommunications). Most antitrust issues have been back and forth to the Supreme Court repeatedly. This allows students to see how succeeding generations of great judges have wrestled with the core issues in the field. For these reasons, the great beauty of antitrust is to see it as, essentially, a common law subject, evolving and adapting over its 120-year history. We will do that by reading and studying the wonderful opinions that enliven this field.|Andrew Rosenfield|[40579]|1|Law School|CRS

It is not a traditional course in comparative law, in that it focuses not so much on particular rules of substantive law but on the structure of different legal systems and the consequences of those structural differences for law and society. In particular, we will focus on the economic impact of legal traditions. Readings will be drawn from legal and social science literature, including works from anthropology, economics, political science and sociology. The course will explicitly cover non-Western legal traditions to an extent not found in conventional comparative law courses.

It is not a high-level survey course; instead, the course will consider issues such as why Delaware occupies a dominant position in the field of corporate law, and will explore particular aspects of that law, including judicial standards of review, common law fiduciary duties of managers and directors, change of control transactions, conflict transactions, poison pills, and defensive mechanisms, all in the context of particular decisions by the Delaware Court of Chancery and Supreme Court.

LAWS43205|Mon Wed Thu : 02:45 PM-03:50 PM|The Constitution Goes to School|[]|Laird Bell Quadrangle V|Closed|"(BID, CORE, 1E) This course will examine how the Supreme Court's constitutional opinions have both shaped and misshaped the nation's public schools. In 1969, the Supreme Court famously declared that students do not ""shed their constitutional rights when they enter the schoolhouse gate."" Not surprisingly, though, Supreme Court Justices both before and since have bitterly contested the precise scope of students' constitutional rights in the elementary and secondary school contexts. Some Justices, moreover, have concluded that it is typically unwise for the judiciary to enter the educational realm, lest the Supreme Court turn into a schoolboard for the entire nation. Even if such fears are overblown, however, there can be no doubt that the Court's constitutional interpretations have had significant consequences for schools charged with transforming students into citizens. Constitutional topics will include: freedom of speech, establishment of religion, free exercise of religion, searches and seizures, cruel and unusual punishment, due process, and equal protection. Educational topics will include: homeschooling, zero tolerance policies, corporal punishment, school funding, school uniforms, racial desegregation, strip searches, single-sex schools, off campus speech, drug testing, unauthorized immigration, the school-to-prison pipeline, and book banning. There are no prerequisites for enrollment. The student's grade is based on a take-home final examination and class participation."|Justin Driver|[40634]|1|Law School|CRS

LAWS43248|Tue : 09:45 AM-01:15 PM|Accounting and Financial Analysis|[]|Laird Bell Quadrangle G|Closed|(++, SKLL, BID, CORE, DOC) This course is designed to refresh your knowledge of basic financial accounting [first two weeks of class] and then aims to aggressively increase your ability to be a highly sophisticated user of financial statements. After taking this course, you should improve your ability to determine a firm's accounting policy for a particular type of transaction and to determine how that policy choice affects its primary financial statements. You will also learn how to question whether these effects fairly reflect the underlying economics of the firm's transactions. Asking these questions involves an interplay between accounting, economics, finance, law and business strategy. You should therefore greatly improve your ability to use an accounting report as part of an overall assessment of the firm's strategy and the potential rewards and risks of dealing with the firm. The teaching approach will be a roughly equal combination of lecture time and demanding case applications of the lecture material that will involve group case assignments that will form the basis for in-class discussion of the cases. The technical knowledge acquired from the lecture material is applied to cases where the main goal is to examine how the reported financial statements would differ if the firm had used different accounting policies. The focus is on modifying the reported financial statements in order to obtain the cleanest possible inputs for use in such applications as equity valuation, transaction structuring and credit analysis. The topics to be discussed are likely to include the accounting for, and interpretation of: revenue recognition, intercorporate investments, organizational structures (e.g., franchising), debt, and leases. Intensive group hand-in cases will be used to illustrate how the flexibility in financial reporting can reflect both the economics of the firm and the incentives of the managers creating the financial statements. It is REQUIRED that students registering for this course have prior exposure to accounting course work, at least at the level of Fundamentals of Accounting for Attorneys (LAWS 79112 or 53260), but with a strong preference for the stronger background knowledge provided by the Booth course Financial Accounting (B30000).|Philip Berger|[40571]|1|Law School|CRS

LAWS43265|Mon : 09:45 AM-10:50 AM|International Investment Law|[]|Laird Bell Quadrangle C|Closed|(CORE, SRP, WP, BID, SEM) Foreign investment is a central feature of the world economy, and plays an essential role in economic development. It involves a transaction in which an investor in one country (home state) sends capital to another (host state). But in many cases the transaction is subject to what is called in economics a dynamic inconsistency problem, in which the host state’s incentives change once the investment is sunk, and it may want to renege on its promises to the investor. Furthermore, neither side is likely to want any disputes adjudicated in the courts of the other’s country. The global investment regime has arisen to help resolve these problems. The regime includes bilateral investment treaties (known as BITs) as well as multilateral agreements that are embedded in broader treaty structures, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) or the Energy Charter Treaty. This seminar will introduce students to the operation of the investment law regime, with an emphasis on the tensions between home and host states, the impact of the regime on development outcomes, and the relationship between law and arbitration.

LAWS47411|Tue Fri : 01:30 PM-03:15 PM|Jurisprudence I: Theories of Law and Adjudication|[]|Laird Bell Quadrangle D|Closed|(1E, BID, CORE) An examination of classic jurisprudential questions in and around the theory of adjudication: the theory of how judges actually do decide cases and how they ought to decide them. These questions include: Do legal rules really constrain judicial decision-making? What makes a rule (or norm) a rule of the legal system? Are principles of morality legally binding even when such principles have not been enacted into a law by a legislature? (Relatedly, are there objective principles of morality?) When no legal norm controls a case, how ought judges to decide that case? Can there be right answers to legal disputes, even when informed judges and lawyers disagree about the answer? Are there principles or methods of legal reasoning that constrain judicial decision-making, or is legal reasoning essentially indeterminate, such that a skillful judge can justify more than one outcome for any given dispute? Is judicial decision-making really distinct from political decision-making of the sort legislators engage in? Readings drawn exclusively from major twentieth-century schools of thought - especially American Legal Realism (e.g., Karl Llewellyn, Jerome Frank), Natural Law (e.g., Ronald Dworkin, John Finnis), and Legal Positivism (e.g., H.L.A. Hart, Joseph Raz) - supplemented by other pertinent readings (from Leslie Green, Richard Posner, and the instructor, among others). No familiarity with either jurisprudence or philosophy will be presupposed, though some readings will be philosophically demanding, and the course will sometimes venture into (and explain) cognate philosophical issues in philosophy of language and metaethics as they are relevant to the core jurisprudential questions. Attendance at the first session is mandatory for those who want to enroll. Take-home essay exam.|Brian Leiter|[40616]|1|Law School|CRS

After studying some key historical texts in the Western tradition (Wollstonecraft, Rousseau, J. S. Mill), we examine four types of contemporary philosophical feminism: Liberal Feminism (Susan Moller Okin, Martha Nussbaum), Radical Feminism (Catharine MacKinnon, Andrea Dworkin), Difference Feminism (Carol Gilligan, Annette Baier, Nel Noddings), and Postmodern ""Queer"" Gender Theory (Judith Butler, Michael Warner). After studying each of these approaches, we will focus on political and ethical problems of contemporary international feminism, asking how well each of the approaches addresses these problems.

LAWS53111|Mon Wed Thu : 11:00 AM-12:05 PM|Buyouts|[]|Laird Bell Quadrangle F|Closed|(WP, BID, CORE) In this course we will examine possible conflicts of interest in mergers and acquisitions, and especially in going private transactions in which publicly held companies are acquired by controlling shareholders or by entities with the participation or support of the company's management. Both types of transactions may raise conflict of interest issues because some of the company's directors or officers, who are charged with protecting the public shareholders, may be accused of having interests adverse to those of the public shareholders. We will examine the methods that Delaware law has provided for dealing with these possible conflicts of interest and the consequences of employing these methods. We will also look at some other issues raised by going private transactions and certain conflict and other issues that can arise in transactions even if they are neither controlling shareholder buyouts nor buyouts involving the company’s management. Finally, we will examine the role of the financial advisors and lawyers who are involved in these transactions. Some of the topics in this seminar will also be covered in Mergers and Acquisitions, but that course is not a prerequisite for this seminar and students may take both classes. Grades will be based on a paper and on class participation.|Scott Davis|[40582]|1|Law School|CRS

We will also look at advocacy strategies for addressing those threats and barriers. Grades are based on a final paper and class participation.|Lorie Chaiten|[40630]|1|Law School|SEM
LAWS53208|Mon : 04:00 PM-06:00 PM|Public Corruption and the Law|[]|Laird Bell Quadrangle III|Closed|"(++, WP, BID, SEM, LEC) This seminar will focus on how governments use the law to prevent and catch public corruption, how the law is sometimes used to protect public corruption, and how one should determine the optimal response to corruption and its consequences. We will examine the substantive criminal laws and sentencing schemes used in the best public corruption prosecutions, ranging from RICO and ""honest services"" fraud to bribery and extortion laws. We will also examine the laws that create, authorize, or prevent the most effective investigative tools used by law enforcement against public corruption, including wiretap laws and related privacy issues. We will study several key topics within public corruption law, including patronage, its effect on democratic institutions, and its status under the First Amendment; campaign finance reform and whether money in campaigns is protected speech or a corrupting influence (or both); and the relationship between transparency, online access to information, and corruption. We will also consider an economic analysis of public corruption, including questions about whether the level of democracy, and the pervasiveness of corruption in the culture, affect the cost-benefit analysis. Constitutional Law I and II are recommended pre-requisites. Students taking the class for 3 credits write one short reaction paper (or short research paper if appropriate), and one major paper. Those taking it for 2 credits write several short reaction papers."|David Hoffman|[40641]|1|Law School|SEM

Drawing from feminist economics research, the seminar will address the persistence of gender inequality in societies around the world and proposed policy solutions. Topics will include gender relations and the organization of domestic and market work, violence against women, workplace and pay equality, gendered access to resources, education, and healthcare, and gender and property rights. Evaluation will be based on class participation, and short research/response papers. Students may write a larger paper for the extra credit.|Diana Strassmann|[55342]|1|Law School|SEM
LAWS53219|Thu : 04:00 PM-06:00 PM|Counterintelligence and Covert Action - Legal and Policy Issues|[]|Laird Bell Quadrangle I|Closed|(WP, BID, SEM, LEC) This seminar will focus on the constitutional and legal framework for counterintelligence and other instruments of national power that seek to neutralize and/or exploit our adversaries' intelligence activities against US national security interests. Such adversaries may include foreign intelligence services, terrorists, foreign criminal enterprises, cyber intruders, or some combination thereof. The seminar will consider both legal and policy issues raised in efforts to prevent adversarial espionage action -- overt, covert, or clandestine -- targeting US military, diplomatic, and economic interests at home and abroad. The seminar will also explore the role and overlap of covert action, roughly defined as action intended to influence events in another nation or territory without revealing the involvement of the sponsor. Although the primary focus of the seminar will be separation of powers issues and the role of executive power in counterintelligence and covert action, care will be taken to consider less frequently discussed implications for domestic and international economies and markets, as well as the extent to which economic and market considerations motivate policy making or legal decisions. The seminar will include short case studies from the Cold War and post-Cold War eras in the US, Latin America, the Middle East, and the former USSR. The seminar is designed to minimize overlap with the material covered in The Law of Counterterrorism (LAWS 70704 or 43221) and National Security Issues (LAWS 70703 or 53217) by primarily focusing attention on state actors rather than nonstate actors. Grades will be based upon a final paper, occasional short response papers, and reasonable class participation.|Stephen Cowen, Tony Garcia|[40598]|1|Law School|SEM
LAWS53223|Mon : 06:10 PM-08:10 PM|Structuring Financial Instruments|[]|Laird Bell Quadrangle E|Closed|(++, WP, SKLL, BID, SEM, LEC) This seminar introduces tax, legal, accounting and economic principles relevant to the structuring of complex financial instrumentsâ€”from forwards, swaps and options to convertible bonds and other securities with embedded derivatives. Throughout the seminar, different products designed to achieve similar economic goals will be examined to highlight the significance of structuring choices and the range of techniques available. For example, there are various products that can be used to approximate the economics of buying an asset, without an actual purchase of that asset. The seminar will examine how these products are treated differently for tax, securities law, commodities law, bankruptcy, accounting and other purposes, notwithstanding their economic similarity. Students will develop the ability to optimize transactions by selecting among existing financial instruments or inventing new ones. The seminar will also include discussion of policy issues. No specific prerequisites, but introductory income tax recommended, and knowledge of securities law and bankruptcy law helpful. The seminar will be assessed via a) a series of reaction papers (2 credits) or b) via a full-length research paper (3 credits). Class participation and attendance will be considered.|Jason Sussman|[40631]|1|Law School|SEM

Using a hypothetical case, students will explore the practical application of key patent law and litigation concepts. Students will follow the litigation over the course of the term as counsel for plaintiff or defendant. Students will be asked to produce written work (e.g., pleadings, motion papers, deposition outlines, etc.) and to orally argue motions. Potential topics include motions to dismiss or transfer, discovery disputes, claim construction, expert discovery, summary judgment, and appeals. In addition to oral argument, class will discuss practical and legal topics pertaining to patent litigation, typically to assist in preparation of the next week's assignment.|Steven Cherny, Jason Wilcox|[40627]|1|Law School|SEM
LAWS53281|Fri : 09:45 AM-11:45 AM|The US-China Treaty Project|[]|Laird Bell Quadrangle C|Closed|(BID, LEC, SEM, WP) The United States and China appear to be heading toward an era of confrontation rather than cooperation. China is growing stronger and more influential in every domain worldwide and likely to increasingly threaten the status quo. The U.S., meanwhile, finds itself in the grips of a populist movement led by President Trump, who is openly critical of China. The relationship, which was already mistrustful, has grown even more fragile and anxious in recent weeks with talk of tariffs, Taiwan, and the South China Sea. The accusations and threats suggest that we are likely to witness greater turbulence than what we have experienced in the past forty years. The reality is that both nations need each other; both have significant economic, political, and security interests at stake. If the two nations learn how to collaborate, they could conceivably solve the world’s greatest problems. Alternatively, if they elect to contest each other at every turn, the result will be global instability and crisis. Clearly, a new framework for cooperation and collaboration is needed – quite possibly “a new deal,” in the language of President Trump. What will constitute such a deal? How will it work? How likely is a deal, and, if one does occur, will it survive the volatility of an America First foreign policy? This seminar will advocate that the two nations develop a new, fifty-year treaty in the form of a strategic cooperation agreement. We will define the rationale and the case for action, draft major components of the proposed treaty, outline the pathway required for adoption, and transmit our end-product to foreign policy authorities in Washington and Beijing. Grading will be determined by class participation and by performance across three short papers. The first paper will examine best practices in bilateral treaty development; the second will focus on critical factors in the future United States - China relationship; and, the third will require drafting of key components for the proposed treaty.|Tom Manning|[40636]|1|Law School|SEM

In the last decade, we have witnessed the expansion of environmental finance to new products - carbon dioxide spot and futures contracts, sulfur dioxide futures and over-the-counter water contracts - that are now fully integrated financial instruments for hedging and speculation. These mechanisms also have potential benefits to address issues in other pressing matters such as water quality, fisheries and biodiversity protection.

LAWS53317|Mon : 04:00 PM-06:00 PM|Compliance and Regulatory Strategy|[]|Laird Bell Quadrangle E|Closed|(BID, LEC, SIM) Since the financial crisis of 2008, regulators and prosecutors around the world increasingly expect companies to have state of the art governance, risk and compliance programs as a condition for remaining in business and for avoiding liabilities for regulatory missteps. Increasingly, regulatory rules are becoming more complex and authorities are becoming more unforgiving, with stepped up efforts to secure criminal and civil penalties against companies, their executives, lawyers and auditors. For companies, such liability can at best result in plummeting share prices, and at worst the shutting down of an enterprise. For individuals, they can result in incarceration, fines, penalties and removal from the business. While many of the principles apply to all industries, the seminar will explore the regulatory and legal foundations for these programs primarily through the lens of the financial services sector, which includes banks, brokerage firms, investment companies and investment advisers. We will also explore how the design and execution of these programs can avoid or limit potential liabilities from regulatory and criminal authorities. From the perspective of a corporate executive, board member or counsel, students will develop the ability to understand the fundamentals of regulatory regimes overseeing these businesses, as well as strategies for successfully engaging the regulators. Students will consider the steps a firm should take to mitigate regulatory and reputation risk, including the importance of an effective corporate ethics program, as well as how, in the process, a firm can enhance its brand, meet the expectations of its board of directors and create value for its shareholders.|Charles Senatore|[40589]|1|Law School|SIM

Professor Buss serves as one of the Reporters on the ALI's new Restatement of Children and the Law, and work for this course offers students an opportunity to contribute to that drafting and advising process. After the first few sessions, in which students will gain basic grounding in children's rights and the Restatement process, students will prepare and present draft Restatement portions focused on a topic of their choice, to be discussed and reviewed by their classmates, who will serve in the ALI adviser's role. Possible topics include school speech, search and seizures in schools and elsewhere, rights and limits of religious observance in schools, gender identity rights, rights to access medical and reproductive care, among others. After the seminar concludes, students will submit a final, revised Restatement portion (black letter law, comments, and reporter's notes), which will qualify for SRP credit. Prior enrollment in Con Law VII (Parent, Child & State) or The Constitution Goes to School does not preclude enrollment in this seminar, as student work in the seminar will focus on a specific topic and general discussion will focus on the Restatement process and the particular questions pressed in that context.|Emily Buss|[40583]|1|Law School|SEM
LAWS53353|Thu : 04:00 PM-06:00 PM|Criminology and Criminal Procedure|[]|Laird Bell Quadrangle A|Closed|(BID,WP, LEC, SEM) This seminar uses social science research to examine the empirical assumptions of rules and systems of criminal law and procedure. We will cover a series of empirical questions that are likely to include: (1) Does the death penalty deter crime? (2) Are there alternatives to incarceration that can keep us safe? (3) Does stop and frisk policing reduce crime? (4) Is there racial disparity in sentencing, and can we do anything about it? (5) Are juries any better than judges at fact-finding? (6) What is the right age of majority to separate the juvenile and adult justice systems? While some background in social science research and statistics may be helpful, it is not a requirement for the course. Students will be evaluated based on class participation and a series of reaction papers (two credits).

In so doing, they will be directly involved in testing the socio-legal principles, theories and critiques they explore in class in the crucible of the work they do helping to lay the regulatory and legal foundations for Hopi tribal institutions. In this practicum, almost every project that a student will work on will involve important questions of first impression with respect to a wide variety of pressing, yet enduring sociolegal issues, including issues of constitutionalism (separations of powers, checks and balances, etc.), crime and punishment (criminal law enforcement and defendants' and victims' rights), civil procedure (due process, appellate procedure, motions and orders), private law (property, contract, family), pluralism (the role of Anglo-American vs. Hopi traditional norms, and alternative dispute resolution), among many others. Given the centrality of these issues to the philosophy, social science, and practice of law - whether in the context of indigenous self-governance and settler colonialism, or otherwise -we believe that there are few other opportunities like this one, where students will encounter, explore and work through, the profound governance and legal issues and discussions offered by the Hopi Tribal Law Practicum.|M.

The course will kick off in the first week with a historical perspective on the evolution of policing strategies since the 1970's covering broad conceptual topics such as the ""broken windows"" theory. Following the initial class, each week will focus on a specific policy issue or policing strategy. Issues to be covered including policing strategies to address violent crime, narcotics trafficking and terrorism. Additional topics to be covered will include community policing, procedural justice, and crisis intervention. Readings will be comprised on books, cases and other relevant publications.

LAWS53364|Tue : 09:45 AM-11:45 AM|Legal History of Early China|[]|Laird Bell Quadrangle E|Closed|(BID, CL, LEC, SEM) The purpose of this course is to enhance the students’ understanding of the application of law and legal theory through study of the growing body of legal texts from pre-imperial and early imperial China. In addition to situating the Chinese legal materials in their varying legal, social, political, cultural and historical contexts, and thereby highlighting some of their unique elements, the course also familiarizes students with a wide range of theoretical materials (eg., anthropological, legal philosophical, economic, etc.) which may be useful in bringing to light any universalities of legal systems and behavior. However, discussion of any given text will be directed in large part by the nature and contents of the material itself. The Chinese materials, all readings of which will be in translation, range from commemorative inscriptions cast in bronze sacral vessels and descriptions of legal practices in received texts, to actual statutes and case records, philosophical texts and legal debates. The medium, discovery/transmission, and authorship of each document will be given due consideration for the effect they may have on our understanding of the contemporary legal context from which the text derives. The course culminates with student presentations on the material of their choice. Preparation for presentations will be conducted in consult with the instructor. Students are encouraged to draw from their study of other legal systems and/or systems of legal thought (both modern and pre-modern) in their discussion of the ancient Chinese material. It is hoped that the course will help students question their own assumptions about legal behavior, and the nature and role of law and legal systems in early China, specifically, and within the human world, generally. Students in Humanities/Social Sciences may apply to take this course.|Laura Skosey|[40620]|1|Law School|SEM
LAWS53366|Tue : 09:45 AM-11:45 AM|Merger and Acquisition Agreements|[]|Laird Bell Quadrangle F|Closed|(BID, CORE, SEM) In this course we will examine certain issues that may arise in the negotiation of: (1) merger agreements in which the target is a public company; and (2) asset purchase agreements. For each type of agreement, we will begin with an examination of a model agreement and a discussion of significant issues that tend to be present. The members of the class will then have a simulated negotiation based on written hypothetical situations in which they will be attempting to reach an agreement and negotiate contractual language that would be part of the type of agreement at issue. In the simulated negotiation for each type of agreement all members of the class will be identified as counsel or a business representative for either (a) the buyer or (b) the target or the seller. The class will be divided into four groups, two (Group 1 and Group 2) for the buyer and two (Group 3 and Group 4) for the target or seller. Group 1 will negotiate with Group 3. Group 2 will separately negotiate with Group 4. Groups 1 and 3 will not communicate with Groups 2 and 4. Each student will be counsel to a party at least once. We will also have short discussions about negotiation ethics and about negotiating and drafting. Grades will be based on: (i) two three to five page papers describing the student’s negotiating experience for each agreement, and what the student would do differently in the future; (ii) classroom performance; and (iii) the contractual language submitted for each agreement (or what they proposed if no agreement is reached). Some of the topics in this course will also be covered in Mergers and Acquisitions, but that course is not a prerequisite for this course and students may take both courses.|Scott Davis|[40625]|1|Law School|SEM
LAWS53375|Thu : 09:45 AM-11:45 AM|Theoretical and Comparative Aspects of Corporate Governance|[]|Laird Bell Quadrangle VI|Closed|(++, BID, CORE, SEM, SRP) In this seminar we shall explore some key concepts in corporate law from a theoretical (i.e. non-doctrinal) perspective. The materials will borrow heavily from the economic, psychological, financial and accounting literature. By the same token no formal education in either of these disciplines or in math is expected. Doctrinal materials will be treated as empirical observations. For instance, we might note that a given judicial dictum was made by some court as one notes the occurrence of facts, but then explore whether that dictum generates an optimal result. The seminar will be divided in two parts. During approximately the first half of the quarter I shall deliver introductory lectures. In the second half the students will make oral presentations on topics of their choice, which naturally will pertain to the subject of the seminar. Prior to making those presentations the students will be expected to consult with me in order to make sure that their respective presentations are going in the right direction. By the end of the term the students will submit a written paper on the subject of their oral presentations. There will be no final exam. The final grade for students choosing not to be evaluated on a pass/fail basis will be the oral presentation (10%), class participation (10%) and the final written paper (80%).

We will start with the history of the Chicago Police Department and calls for reform before turning to recent and current events. We will have outside speakers who will present in the seminar and/or at lunch talks. Beyond history, topics will include: crime in Chicago; basic police practices regarding hiring, training, collective bargaining, arbitration, deployment (including community policing); the significance of neighborhoods and politics; Stop and Frisk practices; police violence, especially shootings and the torture scandal; citizen complaints and internal discipline; and mechanisms of accountability. Students will participate in the discussion and write a series of reaction memos about the readings and speakers, which will include attendance at a chosen subset of relevant lunch talks.

LAWS53391|Tue : 04:00 PM-06:00 PM|The Supreme Court Clerkship: Substance and Process|[]|Laird Bell Quadrangle A|Closed|(++, LEC, SEM, SKLL, WP) This seminar is designed to closely replicate the actual responsibilities of a law clerk to a United States Supreme Court Justice. The first class will take the form of an interview. Prospective clerks will face a range of questions designed to test their approach to statutory and constitutional interpretation while gauging their familiarity with pending, recent, and seminal cases. (You will all be hired!) In subsequent classes, clerks will: (1) circulate and review cert-pool memos for actual, pending petitions for writs of certiorari. These memos help the full Court determine which cases to hear on the merits; (2) review merits briefs and write a bench memo to assist your Justice at oral argument and at Conference (where the Justices meet to resolve argued matters); (3) draft a judicial opinion assigned to your Justice (which may well entail a judgment or legal reasoning the clerk does not agree with); and (4) lead class discussion and debate for the cert-pool and merits cases for which the clerk took primary responsibility. Over the course of the seminar, each clerk will write three cert-pool memos, one bench memo, and one opinion. The seminar is aimed at students who have or seek a state or federal clerkship and those with a possible interest in clerking for a U.S. Supreme Court Justice. A firm background in constitutional law is strongly recommended, and your open-minded Justice seeks applicants with a wide array of political and jurisprudential perspectives. Grades will be based on a combination of draft opinions, class participation, cert-pool memos, and bench memos. Students may only enroll with the permission of the instructor. Students interested in enrolling should email Mr. Keller (akeller@uchicago.edu) and submit a resume and a short statement of interest explaining why they would like to enroll in the seminar no later than February 17, 2017.

While Trump’s supporters celebrated the victory of their candidate, many of Trump’s critics argued that Trump’s election was illegitimate, and demonstrators took to the streets. Even after a short time in office, Trump’s actions have—according to his critics—showed a profound indifference to democratic institutions. They complain that he has violated constitutional norms by retaining his business ties, issuing aggressive executive orders, and attacking the press, among other actions. But are the critics right? Is Trump a normal president or a constitutional aberration? We will examine these questions from the standpoint of law, history, and political theory.

LAWS53393|Wed : 04:00 PM-06:00 PM|Race and American Law: Identity, Education, and Criminal Justice|[]|Laird Bell Quadrangle B|Closed|(BID, LEC, SEM) After Obama’s historical election, many declared that the United States had finally become a post-racial nation. The assumption was that if the country could elect a black President, then surely racism and prejudice were evils of the past. But then came the killings of Freddie Gray, Michael Brown, Sandra Bland, Eric Garner and others, and the community responses in Ferguson, Baltimore, and other cities across the country. These events, in turn, led to several criminal trials and federal investigations, and showed the salience of race in the operation of the criminal justice system. The assertion that “Black Lives Matter” became a rallying cry, and what started as a hashtag turned into a movement. This seminar will examine the role of law in creating and recreating race in our decidedly non-post-racial society. Topics covered will include racial identity, education, and criminal justice. Readings will include cases to understand the “law on the books;” law review articles to understand how legal academics interact the law and its implications; and social science research to understand “law in action.” Students will be evaluated as follows. For 2 credits, students will write three response papers, 4-5 pages each, on 3 different set of readings, due the day before that class meets. For students wishing to take the course for 3 credits, the student must write a 20-25 page research paper on a topic of interest to the student and approved by the instructor.|LaToya Baldwin Clark|[44036]|1|Law School|SEM
LAWS53394|Wed : 04:00 PM-06:00 PM|Advanced Readings in Japanese Law|[]|Laird Bell Quadrangle G|Closed|(BID, CORE, SEM) For this seminar, we will read a variety of Japanese-language material on one or more legal topics. Typically, we will begin with a relatively accessible essay, and shift toward more difficult material — ultimately, to a court opinion. I will adjust the amount and difficulty of the material to the language ability that students bring. In general, however, students should have at least two years’ Japanese language background or the equivalent. If you have any question whether this would be an appropriate course for you, please contact me directly. I will pick the topic of the readings according to student interest. Students whose first language is Japanese cannot take the class for credit, but are welcome to audit the class. If you’d like an auditor’s form, please email registrar@law.uchicago.edu. Grades will be based on class participation, several translations, and several short essay exercises. They will take each student’s beginning linguistic skills as a given — such that having a higher or lower language ability at the start of the quarter will be neither an advantage nor a disadvantage.|J Mark Ramseyer|[44041]|1|Law School|SEM
LAWS53395|Tue : 04:00 PM-06:00 PM|Strategic Considerations in Securities and Corporate Governance Litigation|[]|Laird Bell Quadrangle D|Closed|(BID, LEC, SEM) This seminar will introduce students to the most important strategic considerations that lawyers encounter in today’s highly sophisticated financial services litigation. The litigators (and corporate lawyers) who concentrate in this area must function in an environment where the stakes are high, leverage is critical, and “victory” is defined by the client, not the court. Accordingly, this seminar examines the critical questions faced in virtually every financial services litigation matter including: (1) which is the most favorable venue for this litigation, including consideration of how legal principles vary jurisdiction by jurisdiction; (2) how does Directors and Officers Liability insurance impact the litigation, itself; (3) strategic considerations relating to the composition of the board and use of special litigation committees; (4) how dispositive motions can be used to, at a minimum, best frame and limit the litigation; (5) how derivative and class certification mechanisms can be used to narrow or defeat claims; (6) how to use the timing and positioning of mediation to produce a favorable result for the client; (7) who of your pool of potential experts should be identified, on what topics, and when to maximize chances of success; and (8) what is jury research and what role does it play in making thematic and settlement decisions. To further the student experience, we will supplement our sessions by bringing some of the nation’s top litigators and practioners in fields like jury research, D&O insurance, mediation and/or damage analysis to share their years of expertise drawn from real world situations. Grading will be based on class participation and a series of three 5-page papers which will focus on discrete topics covered in class and in the reading assignments. Each paper will count for approximately 25% of your grade, and the remaining 25% will be based on class participation.|Steven Feirson, Joni Jacobsen|[54338]|1|Law School|SEM

During the Autumn quarter, students will read, discuss, and critique some of the most influential law review articles from the twentieth century, as well as newer papers that extend and apply those canonical ideas to modern legal problems. The readings will consist of a healthy mix of public law and private law, and various scholarly methodologies. During the Autumn quarter, students will have short research and writing assignments on the readings. Students will also work with faculty to identify a topic for a substantial research paper. During the Winter quarter, the seminar will not meet in formal sessions, but each student will work on his or her research paper and will meet individually with the instructors to assess the paper’s progress. During the Spring quarter, the seminar will reconvene, and students will workshop their drafts (i.e., each student will circulate his or her draft in advance and answer questions from students and faculty). Students will receive an Autumn quarter grade based on their short writing assignments, discussion facilitation, and class participation. Students will receive a separate grade for the Winter and Spring quarters based on the quality of their research papers and class participation. Every student must enroll for the entire year; students may not drop the class after the Autumn quarter. Students may only enroll with the permission of the instructors.

We focus primarily on the patchwork of government programs we call the “safety net”such as programs providing cash (welfare), food assistance, and Medicaid. We try to deepen our understanding, as lawyers and as citizens, of how such programs, a frequent source of discussion in current media, function in reality. In the process, we enjoy many opportunities to explore whether and how program structures reflect or reinforce prevailing cultural attitudes and assumptions about program participants including attitudes and assumptions based on gender and race. We also debate, from practical, political, legal and ethical perspectives, what government can or should do, when administering safety net programs, to address what policy makers identify as root causes of American poverty.|Miriam Hallbauer|[40629]|1|Law School|SEM

It admits approximately ten students. Its aim is to study, each year, a topic that arises in both philosophy and the law and to ask how bringing the two fields together may yield mutual illumination. Most sessions are led by visiting speakers, from either outside institutions or our own faculty, who circulate their papers in advance. The session consists of a brief introduction by the speaker, followed by initial questioning by the two faculty coordinators, followed by general discussion, in which students are given priority. The topic for 2016-17 will expose students to cutting-edge work in general jurisprudence, that part of philosophy of law concerned with the central questions about the nature of law, the relationship between law and morality, and the nature of legal reasoning. We will be particularly interested in the way in which work in philosophy of language, metaethics, metaphysics, and other cognate fields of philosophy has influenced recent scholarly debates that have arisen in the wake of H.L.A. Hart’s seminal The Concept of Law (1961). Please see www.law.uchicago.edu/workshops/lawandphilosophy for additional information concerning each session. Usual participants include graduate students in philosophy, political science, and divinity, and law students. Students write a 20-25 page seminar paper at the end of the year. The paper may satisfy the Law School Substantial Writing Requirement. Students must enroll for all three quarters to receive credit. Students are admitted by permission of the instructors.

In a case law system such as that of the United States, a realistic understanding of judicial behavior, which conventional legal instruction does not convey, is essential to the understanding and practice of law. Over the course of the academic year, six scholars from the fields of law and the social sciences will present their work. By the end of the academic year, students will produce a major research paper on judicial behavior.

It is open to all students, including JSDs and LLMs. Students registered for the full year are required to either write a paper of publishable quality or revise a previously written paper for publication. The goal is to prepare students for the academic job market. Special attention is paid to topic selection, how to approach working on an original (not synthetic) project, and presentation skills. Students enrolled for the year will be expected to conduct themselves as they would if they were junior faculty members at a top law school, reading and commenting on the work of their peers. Optional lunches to discuss writing will be held throughout the year in the same format as the Faculty Round Table. The goal is to create a learning community that will provide students with the type of scholarly atmosphere the faculty here enjoys. There will be meetings on average every other week during Winter and Spring Quarters. The Autumn quarter only option is designed for several audiences: (1) students who want to decide if an academic career is for them; (2) students who wish to improve their skills as a public speaker; (3) students who want to improve their skills of critique while reading papers from a wide variety of subject areas; (4) and students who simply enjoy arguing about the law. Each week a young scholar present works-in progress and students play the role of the faculty in a faculty workshop. The class and the professor then provide feedback and suggestions to the presenter on aspects of both presentation style and the substance of the paper.

LAWS81007|Fri : 09:45 AM-11:45 AM|Alternative Dispute Resolution|[]|Laird Bell Quadrangle A|Closed|(SKLL, BID, SIM, LEC) This is a class in the dispute resolution methods that attorneys often use in the practice of law. The class provides experiential simulations in negotiation, mediation, and arbitration. The class differs from most other law classes in the following ways: 1. Many classes teach a substantive body of law; this class, in contrast, is designed to teach a variety of lawyering skills. 2. In most classes, students participate strictly as individuals; in contrast, students in this class often interact in small group settings and simulations, and therefore, must listen to and cooperate with peers while working through their disagreements. 3. Many classes measure student performance once, at the end of the semester, through an issue-spotting exam; in contrast, this class requires brief reflection papers that are based on a combination of readings, group activities, and simulated exercises. 4. Most classes involve little or no role playing; in contrast, this class gives students the experience of being a negotiator, trial advocate, arbitrator, mediator, victim/complainant and defendant/respondent in an adversarial proceeding. The instructor will base simulations on cases from his private arbitration practice. Students will be required to sign and abide by a confidentiality agreement with respect to these sensitive materials.|Michael Leroy|[40577]|1|Law School|SIM

LAWS90211|Tue : 10:25 AM-12:10 PM|Young Center Immigrant Child Advocacy Clinic|[]|Laird Bell Quadrangle B|Open|The Young Center for Immigrant Children's Rights Clinic combines international human rights law, immigration law and children's rights law. Students in the clinic are appointed by the federal government as Child Advocate (similar to a guardian ad litem) for unaccompanied immigrant children detained in Chicago. Unaccompanied immigrant children come to the U.S. from all corners of the world, on their own. They are apprehended—typically at the U.S./Mexico border—then detained and placed in deportation proceedings. Direct Client Service: Pursuant to federal law, the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, the Young Center is appointed as Child Advocate for the most vulnerable of these children (tender age children, children with mental or physical disabilities, children who have experienced extensive trauma, etc.). Law students serve as Child Advocate for individual children, and are responsible for advocating for the best interests of the assigned child on issues relating to safe repatriation, legal relief, care, custody and release. Each student meets weekly with the child at the detention facility, and advocates on behalf of the child with federal officials, including immigration judges and asylum officers, under the supervision of Young Center attorneys. Since there currently is no substantive best interests of the child standard under the Immigration and Nationality Act, students look to international human rights law, including the Convention on the Rights of the Child, state child welfare law, and the child protection laws of the child’s home country. Policy Advocacy: In addition to serving as Child Advocate, clinic students have the opportunity to engage in legislative and policy advocacy aimed at improving the immigration system for children in removal proceedings. This is an especially critical time since the government projects 70,000 children will arrive at the border this year. Young Center students will do policy advocacy aimed at reforming procedural and substantive legal protections, including the appointment of counsel for immigrant children and incorporation of a substantive best interests of the child standard in the Immigration and Nationality Act. Students must enroll in the Autumn quarter and participate in a 2-day orientation on Oct 1st and 2nd (Saturday and Sunday). The Young Center Clinic admits both second-year and third-year law students. Language skills are not required, but students who speak Spanish, Mandarin, Hindi, Gujarati, Punjabi or Urdu are strongly encouraged to apply.|Kelly Albinak, Marcy Phillips, Maria Woltjen, Xiaorong Wu|[54996]|1|Law School|CLN

Students engaged in litigation may interview clients and witnesses; research and draft pleadings and legal memoranda, including briefs to reviewing courts; conduct formal and informal discovery; negotiate with opposing counsel and others; conduct evidentiary hearings and trials; and present oral argument in trial and appellate courts. Students who have completed fifty percent of the credits needed for graduation may be licensed to appear, under the supervision of the clinical teacher, in state and federal trial and appellate courts pursuant to court rules and practices. Students engaged in legislative advocacy may research and draft legislation and supporting materials, devise and implement strategies to obtain the enactment or defeat of legislation, negotiate with representatives of various interest groups, and testify in legislative hearings. In addition to discrete advocacy skills such as cross-examination, discovery planning, and legislative drafting, the course aims to provide students with an understanding of the relationships between individual advocacy tasks and the ultimate goals of clients, between litigation and legislative advocacy, and between advocacy on behalf of individual clients and advocacy for systemic change. Prior or contemporaneous enrollment in Law and the Mental Health System is encouraged, but not required, for all students. See the general rules for all clinical courses for further details concerning enrollment, including the rules governing the award of credit.

LAWS90913|TBA|Civil Rights Clinic: Police Accountability|[]|Laird Bell Quadrangle ARR|Closed|(++, A, SKLL, CLN) The Civil Rights and Police Accountability Project (PAP) is one of the nation’s leading law civil rights clinics focusing on issues of criminal justice. Through the lens of live-client work, students examine how and where litigation fits into broader efforts to improve police accountability and ultimately the criminal justice system. Students provide legal services to indigent victims of police abuse in federal and state courts. They litigate civil rights cases at each level of the court system from trial through appeals. Some students also represent children and adults in related juvenile or criminal defense matters. Students take primary responsibility for all aspects of the litigation, including client counseling, fact investigation, case strategy, witness interviews, legal research, pleadings and legal memoranda, discovery, depositions, motion practice, evidentiary hearings, trials, and appeals. A significant amount of legal writing is expected. Students work in teams on cases or projects, and meet with the instructor on at minimum a weekly basis. Students also take primary responsibility for the Clinic’s policy and public education work. PAP teaches students to apply and critically examine legal theory in the context of representation of people in need. It teaches students to analyze how and why individual cases of abuse occur and to connect them to systemic problems, often leading to “public impact” litigation and other strategies for policy reform. Through our immersion in live client work, we engage fundamental issues of race, class, and gender, and their intersection with legal institutions. We instruct students in legal ethics and advocacy skills. And we seek to instill in them a public service ethos, as they begin their legal careers. Students are required to complete, prior to their third year, Evidence, Criminal Procedure I, and the Intensive Trial Practice Workshop.

This course will examine this type of structured heterogeneity (Weinreich et al. 1968) from the point of view of sociophonetics. We will focus on the interrelationships between phonetic/phonological form and social factors such as speaking style and the background of the speaker, with a particular interest in explaining the origins and transmission of linguistic change. Our goals will be to (a) acquire the phonetic and phonological foundation necessary to conduct sociophonetic research through practical exercises; (b) survey new sociolinguistic research that addresses issues in phonetic and phonological theories; and (c) locate and explain phonetic variation in its social context while drawing on current approaches to the relationship between language and society. This course will give students hands-on experience with designing and conducting experiments. As part of the empirical foundation of this course, we will focus on sociophonetic variation across Chicago neighborhoods. For a final project, students are required to conduct a small-scale study investigating a research question of relevance to sociophonetic research.

We will situate creoles in the context of the plantation settlement colonies that produced them and compare their emergence specifically with that of languages such as English and the Romance languages in Europe. We will also compare these evolutions with those of new colonial varieties of European languages (such as Amish English, mainstream American English varieties, Brazilian Portuguese, and Québécois French) which emerged around the same time but are not considered creoles. Using the comparative approach (in evolutionary theory), we will assess whether the criteria used in the genetic classification of languages have been applied uniformly to creole and non-creole languages. In return, we will explore ways in which genetic creolistics can inform and improve genetic linguistics (including historical dialectology).|Salikoko Mufwene|[41836]|1|Undergraduate|LEC

In referring to that history, we treat a variety of themes, including migration and its impact, the origins and effects of class stratification, the relation of culture and cultural endeavor to collective consciousness, the rise of institutionalized religions, facts and fictions of political empowerment, and the correspondence of Black lives and living to indices of city wellness (services, schools, safety, general civic feeling). This is a history class that situates itself within a robust interdisciplinary conversation. Students can expect to engage works of autobiography and poetry, sociology, documentary photography, and political science as well as more straightforward historical analysis. By the end of the class, students should have grounding in Black Chicago's history and an appreciation of how this history outlines and anticipates Black life and racial politics in the modern United States.|Adam Green|[42946]|1|Undergraduate|LEC

We then consider imperial debates over taxation in the 1760s and 1770s, returning Benjamin Franklin’s Autobiography to its original context. Reading Paine’s Common Sense and the letters of Abigail Adams and John Adams we look at the multiple meanings of independence. We study Jefferson’s drafting process, read the Declaration over the shoulders of people on both sides of the Atlantic, and consider clues to contemporary meanings beyond the intentions of Congress. Finally, we briefly engage the post-revolutionary history of the place and meaning of the Declaration in American life. (F)|Eric Slauter|[43741]|1|Undergraduate|SEM

This course will be an experiment in linking the extremely pragmatic and the extremely conceptual. Working from a few of the most successful speeches of Presidents Reagan and Obama, we will look to see how the pragmatic and the philosophical shape each other. We will spend roughly half our time on speech-writing nuts-and-bolts, and half our time on some of the philosophical commitments reflected in the language of these two political leaders. (In addition to the speeches themselves, the course reading will include philosophical texts that will provide a frame for examining these commitments.) The course requires weekly exercises, most of which deal with nuts-and-bolts, but a few will analyze the conceptual groundings of the speeches.|Lawrence McEnerney|[40713]|1|Undergraduate|SEM

In most democracies, the distribution of wealth among citizens is unequal but the right to vote is universal. Why then have so many newly democratic states transitioned under conditions of high inequality yet failed to redistribute? This course explores this puzzle by analyzing the mechanisms through which individual and group preferences can be translated into pro-poor policies, and the role elites play in influencing a government's capacity or incentives to redistribute wealth. Topics include economic inequality and the demand for redistribution, the difference in redistribution between democracy and dictatorship, the role of globalization in policymaking, and the effects of redistribution on political stability and change.|Michael Albertus|[41786]|1|Undergraduate|SEM

The main objective of the course is to gain insight into the scope of spatial regression methods, to be able to apply them in an empirical setting, and to properly interpret the results of spatial regression analysis. While the focus is on spatial aspects, the types of methods covered have general validity in statistical practice. The course covers the specification of spatial regression models in order to incorporate spatial dependence and spatial heterogeneity, as well as different estimation methods and specification tests to detect the presence of spatial autocorrelation and spatial heterogeneity. Special attention is paid to the application to spatial models of generic statistical paradigms, such as Maximum Likelihood, Generalized Methods of Moments and the Bayesian perspective. An important aspect of the course is the application of open source software tools such as R, GeoDa and PySal to solve empirical problems.|Luc Anselin|[42095]|1|Graduate|LEC

MAPH34520|Mon Wed : 03:00 PM-04:20 PM|Postcolonial Openings|[]|TBA|Open|In this course, we examine the perspectives, debates, and attitudes that characterize the contemporary field of postcolonial theory, with attention to how its interdisciplinary formation contributes to reading literary works. We begin by surveying the development and trajectory of the field, particularly as it develops around debates on revolution and compromise, cosmopolitanism, the psychology of colonialism, and anti-colonial historiography. Alongside this, we consider the recent disciplinary revival of the categories of “global Anglophone” and “world literature” through readings on “literary worlds” to to evaluate these categories, and their contributions to ongoing debates about translation/translatability, vernaculars, rewriting, and mimicry. What are the claims made on behalf of literary texts in orienting us to other lives and possibilities, and in registering the experience of geographic and cultural displacement? To better answer this, we read recent scholarship that engages the field in conversations around intimacy, belonging, and human rights, to think about the impulses that animate the field, and its possible futures. Readings will likely include works by Debjani Ganguly, Kamau Brathwaite, Jean Rhys, Amitava Kumar, Sara Ahmed and Amitav Ghosh.|Darrel Chia|[54368]|1|Graduate|SEM
MAPH36750|Mon : 12:30 PM-03:20 PM|Anxiety|[]|TBA|Open|The phenomenon of anxiety emerged as one of the leading psychological disorders of the 20th and 21st centuries. Worrying ourselves into the realm of the pathological, we now have a requisite measure of anxiety for every prescribed stage of life. But why are we so anxious? Considering its prevalence in everyday life, the concept and theories of anxiety have been employed surprisingly seldom as a way into film, fiction, and art. In this course we examine the modern origin of contemporary discourses specific to anxiety and their unique manifestation in cultural artifacts. To understand the complex of anxiety in the so-called Western world, we rely on the theories of Søren Kierkegaard, Martin Heidegger, Sigmund Freud, Jacques Lacan, and Alenka Zupančič; fiction by Stoker, Schnitzler, Kafka, and Sebald; and film by Haneke, Kubrick, Ophuls, and Hitchcock. We will also have guest speakers from the fields of clinical psychiatry, geriatric medicine, philosophy, and comparative anthropology.|Anne Flannery, Malynne Sternstein|[41038]|1|Graduate|SEM
MAPH37818|Mon Wed : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM|Consent and Coercion: Rights, Agency, and Authority in the Eighteenth Century and Beyond|[]|TBA|Open|In American popular culture, the eighteenth century is remembered today (to the extent that it is remembered at all) as a heady time of revolutions and revolutionaries, when towering figures of the Enlightenment established modern democracy. This, in many ways, reflects the narrative eighteenth-century writers were developing about their own age. For British Whigs, the “Glorious Revolution” of 1688 had been a watershed moment at which the arbitrary rule of kings had been replaced for all time by constitutionalism; the social contract and the civil polity had triumphed over divine-right ideology, ushering in a new, beneficent era of progress. And, in the 1790s, the French Revolution fired the political imaginations of British radicals who saw the potential for a world made anew – a world of universal suffrage and gender equality, where slavery was abolished. Clearly, attaining these goals was a long way off. The debates over the structures, meanings, and nature of consent had tendrils in multiple areas of society – the law, of course, but also in understandings of sexuality, constructions of gender, economics, and colonization. Questions of rights, agency, and authority (what those categories meant, who could possess them, and who guaranteed them) were by no means settled, and, indeed, throughout the century, calls to curtail the categories of people who should have access to the sphere of political influence were often as boisterous as those to expand such access. This course will explore how a range of authors in eighteenth-century Britain figured questions of consent, rights, and authority and how the ideological debates these authors mediated continue to inform contemporary politics, cultures, and identities. We will read works by literary figures such as Daniel Defoe, Samuel Richardson, Mary Hays, Olaudah Equiano, and Mary Shelley. We will consider the writings of some of the major political philosophers of the day, as well, including John Locke, Thomas Hobbes, Mary Astell, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Thomas Paine, and Mary Wollstonecraft. We will additionally discuss readings in modern criticism and theory to help us better situate our primary texts in the discourses of modernity and better understand their lasting resonances.|Tristan Schweiger|[42899]|1|Graduate|SEM

MAPH41300|Tue Thu : 12:00 PM-01:20 PM|Our biopolitics, ourselves: feminist science fiction|[]|TBA|Closed|1970s feminist theory made a significant conceptual move in provisionally bracketing off biological sex from the historical/cultural work of gender. Feminist science fiction (in contrast), in its brief flourishing in the 70s and early 80s, finds its utopian moments in the biological, in genetic manipulation, reproductive technology, ecological forms of being and new bodies of a variety of kinds. This class will read science fiction, feminist theory and current critical work that concerns itself with bios, biology and biopolitics in order to ask questions about the divide between nature and culture, what’s entailed in imagining the future, what gender and genre have to do with each other, and just what science fiction is and does anyway. Authors may include: Le Guin, Russ, Butler, Piercy, McIntyre, Haraway, Malabou, Fortunati, James, Rubin, Firestone.|Hilary Strang|[42885]|1|Graduate|SEM

In this course we will explore philosophical theories of this elementary and crucial form of justice. Among topics to be considered are the role that dignity and humanity play in grounding such rights, their relation to political and economic institutions, and the distinction between duties of justice and claims of charity or humanitarian aid. Finally we will consider the application of such theories to concrete, problematic and pressing problems, such as global poverty, torture and genocide.|Ben Laurence|[53724]|1|Graduate|LEC

Students will examine the theoretical and methodological groundings of cultural psychiatry, examining how scholars working in the phenomenological tradition have tried to describe the lived experiences of various forms of “psychopathology” or “madness.” By the end of the course, students will have learned how to describe and analyze the social dimension of a mental health experience, using a phenomenologically-grounded anthropological approach, and by adopting a technical vocabulary for understanding the lived experiences of mental illness (for instance, phenomena, life-world, being-in-the-world, intentionality, epoché, embodiment, madness, psychopathology, melancholia/depression, schizophrenia, etc). In addition, given the ongoing problematic of “how to represent mental illness,” students will also have the opportunity to think through the different ways of presenting their analysis, both in the form of weekly blog entries and during a final-week mock-workshop, where they will showcase their work in a creative medium appropriate to that analysis.|Francis McKay|[53673]|1|Graduate|SEM

The tools of engineering are important in making and translating basic discoveries in other fields into new intellectual opportunities and, sometimes, useful technologies. Institute for Molecular Engineering The Institute for Molecular Engineering (IME) is founded on the principle of collaborative problem-solving, not rigid academic disciplines. It is at the forefront of an emerging field that has the potential to address fundamental problems of societal import. This exciting new field involves the incorporation of synthetic molecular building blocks into functional systems that will impact technologies from advanced medical therapies to quantum computing. Created in partnership with Argonne National Laboratory, the IME builds on the tradition of collaboration and cutting-edge research well established at Argonne and the University of Chicago. It conducts research at the intersection of chemical, electrical, mechanical, and biological engineering, as well as materials, biological, and physical sciences. The institute’s exploration of innovative technologies in nanoscale manipulation and design at a molecular scale has the potential for impact in such areas as energy, health care, and the environment. Major Program in Molecular Engineering The BS degree program in Molecular Engineering offers undergraduates a cutting-edge engineering curriculum built on a strong foundation in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology. Courses are designed to develop quantitative reasoning and problem-solving skills; to introduce engineering analysis of physical, chemical, and biological systems; and to address open-ended technological questions across a spectrum of disciplines. The program will both prepare undergraduates for a wide variety of careers in technology-focused industries and position graduates for further postgraduate study in such fields as science, engineering, medicine, business, or law. The aim is to introduce invention and design, along with inquiry and discovery, as fruitful and complementary intellectual activities. Majors are able to choose from two quantitative engineering analysis tracks, one aimed at engineering with a biological, chemical, and soft materials emphasis, and one geared toward applied physics. The applied physics track, offered in close collaboration with the Department of Physics, is one of the first initiatives worldwide to formally educate quantum engineers at the undergraduate level. MENG 29500 Engineering Design is a 300-unit design course offered as a capstone, in which student teams spend an intensive quarter working with a faculty mentor to solve an open-ended problem, for example, analyzing chemical and biological properties of cancer cells to develop new treatment and delivery vehicles or harnessing the properties of electrons in materials to develop quantum information technologies. The course also combines technical skills with an exploration of economics, regulatory and legal issues, and ethics. Major Program Requirements 1. A strong and broad background in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology. It is imperative for a modern engineer to have a strong and broad background in the sciences. Traditional engineering disciplines have had requirements in math, chemistry, and physics for decades and many programs have evolved to require biology as well. The highly interdisciplinary nature of Molecular Engineering requires a foundation built across the mathematical, physical, and biological sciences. Students are encouraged to complete their general education requirements at the highest level for which they are prepared. This will position them better to take advantage of advanced electives and research opportunities. As discussed in more detail below, there will be two tracks for Molecular Engineering majors, one aimed towards engineering with a biological, chemical, and soft materials emphasis, and one aimed towards applied physics. Students in the former track will follow precedent set by Chemistry and Biological Sciences majors in that they will likely take chemistry in year 1, physics in year 2, and follow the recommended mathematics courses in the Chemistry curriculum. Students in the latter track will follow precedent set by Physics majors in that they will likely take physics in year 1, follow the mathematics guidelines of Physics majors, and take chemistry in year 2. 2. MENG 26030 Introduction to Engineering Analysis. One of the first courses for all Molecular Engineering majors, this course teaches students to apply mathematical methods towards solving problems that cut across multiple engineering sub-disciplines. A major objective of the course is to teach simple programming skills and computational methods in applied mathematics, including the use of engineering software such as Matlab, Mathematica, Comsol, and elements of Python. The skills that are introduced here will be further developed and strengthened throughout the rest of the curriculum. 3. Two quantitative engineering analysis tracks: Biological, Chemical, and Soft Materials Engineering and Quantum Engineering. Reflecting the research and education themes of the IME, two highly intertwined but recognizably different tracks for the major are available to students. One is aimed at preparing students oriented towards biological, chemical, and soft materials engineering, and the other is aimed at preparing students oriented towards engineering of quantum-based materials, devices, and processes. The latter track is offered in close collaboration with the Department of Physics. The main difference in the tracks relates to a choice between two sequences of three courses under the heading of quantitative engineering analysis. 4. MENG 29500 Engineering Design (300-unit capstone course). This “immersion” design course teaches students how to bring combinations of fundamental science and engineering together to solve open-ended and challenging engineering problems. It also serves as a vehicle to teach other equally important non-technical skills, including: • Problem identification: technology analysis, competitive analysis, market analysis, stakeholder analysis, product definition • Impact of the project, including sociological and engineering ethics • Project planning • Project economics: costs, value/investment analysis, risk analysis and adjustment • Prototyping, experimental design, data analysis, error analysis • IP: patenting, prior art, patentability • Legal and regulatory analysis • Proposing, presenting and reporting • Teamwork IME faculty and fellows will propose open-ended projects for which they will serve as mentors. Students will work together in groups of three. 5. Materials and advanced electives (3 required courses in the major). The major is offered in such a way as to allow for considerable flexibility for students to tailor their programs along individualized trajectories, with help from faculty advisors. Not only can students choose between two tracks, but they can further build breadth or depth through their choice of a materials course and advanced electives. Moreover, we anticipate that our students will use their general electives outside of the major requirements to strengthen their backgrounds in specific areas of interest, also in consultation with Molecular Engineering advisors, to achieve desired outcomes such as preparation for graduate school in more traditional engineering disciplines. 6. Laboratory skills and hands-on experience. Critical skills that molecular engineers must acquire as part of their educational program include the ability to apply knowledge of mathematics, science, and engineering and the ability to design and conduct experiments, as well as the ability to analyze and interpret data. Molecular Engineering majors develop these skills through lab components associated with required courses in the physical and biological sciences, Molecular Engineering courses including MENG 26101-26102 Transport Phenomena I: Forces + Flows; Transport Phenomena II, MENG 26201-26202 Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics I-II, MENG 29500 Engineering Design, and some of the advanced electives such as MENG 27300 Polymer Physics and Engineering. We also anticipate that many Molecular Engineering students will receive advanced laboratory experience pursuing undergraduate research projects. 7. Non-technical skills. Many decades of workshops and panels engaging stakeholders in academia and industry, often associated with the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET), have identified criteria for outcomes of students in accredited engineering education programs. Although there is no thought of seeking ABET accreditation for the Molecular Engineering major, many ABET criteria, particularly those related to non-technological skills, are viewed as essential to incorporate into the Molecular Engineering major. Examples of student outcomes that fall into this category include: (a) an ability to formulate or design a system, process, or program to meet desired needs, (b) an ability to function on multidisciplinary teams, (c) an understanding of professional and ethical responsibility, (d) an ability to communicate effectively, (e) the broad education necessary to understand the impact of solutions in a global and societal context, (f) a recognition of the need for and an ability to engage in life-long learning, and (g) a knowledge of contemporary issues. Many of these outcomes will be addressed through both the Molecular Engineering degree curriculum (emphasized in the design sequence and the research colloquium) and the College general education requirements. Students who are able to both develop and articulate these skills will be positioned favorably for employment in industry and for postgraduate study (engineering, medicine, law, and business administration). Entering the Program Students must indicate their intent to pursue the BS program at the end of the Autumn Quarter in their second year of study by completing the Intent to Pursue Molecular Engineering questionnaire (available on the IME website). They begin the engineering curriculum in the following Spring Quarter with enrollment in either MENG 26010 Engineering Principles of Conservation or MENG 26020 Engineering Electrodynamics. Both courses require the completion of their stated prerequisites. Students should work with their advisers early in their first year of study to plan for those prerequisites to be completed in a timely manner.

The overall objective of the program is to provide basic engineering tools and ways of thinking to students that augment scientific approaches and problem solving skills. Minor Program Requirements Before a student can declare the minor in molecular engineering, the student must: Complete the general education requirements in mathematics and physical or biological sciences Earn a B or higher in MENG 20000 Introduction to Emerging Technologies Following completion of the general education requirements and MENG 20000 Introduction to Emerging Technologies (with a grade of B or better), students may apply to the director of undergraduate studies of the Institute for Molecular Engineering for admission into the minor in molecular engineering program. A student must receive the director of undergraduate studies’ approval of the minor program on a form obtained from the student's College adviser. Once signed by the director, this form must then be returned to the student's College adviser by the end of Spring Quarter of the student's third year. To earn the minor in molecular engineering, a student must complete five molecular engineering courses chosen in consultation with the director of undergraduate studies. Before meeting with the director, students should invest some thought into which courses they would like to complete for the minor and how those courses relate as a set. MENG 20000 Introduction to Emerging Technologies and MENG 29700 Undergraduate Research for Molecular Engineering must be among the five courses counted toward the minor. In rare cases, courses offered by other departments and programs may be approved by the director of undergraduate studies as substitutes for courses listed above. Courses in the minor program may not be (1) double counted with the student's major(s) or with other minors, or (2) counted toward general education requirements. Courses in the minor must be taken for quality grades, and more than half of the requirements for the minor must be met by registering for courses bearing University of Chicago course numbers. Summary of Requirements for the Minor in Molecular Engineering MENG 20000 Introduction to Emerging Technologies * 100 MENG 29700 Undergraduate Research for Molecular Engineering 100 Three additional courses in Molecular Engineering or other programs ** 300 Total Units 500 * With a grade of B or higher ** Courses not in Molecular Engineering must be approved by the director of undergraduate studies. Grading In order to qualify for the BS degree, a GPA of 2.0 or higher (with no grade lower than C-) is needed in all courses required in the major. Students majoring in Molecular Engineering must receive quality grades in all courses required in the degree program. All courses in the minor must be taken for quality grades. Nonmajors and nonminors may take Molecular Engineering courses on a P/F basis; only grades of C- or higher constitute passing work. Honors Students who pursue a substantive research project with a faculty member of the Institute for Molecular Engineering are encouraged to write and defend an honors thesis based on their work. Students who wish to be considered for honors are expected to complete their arrangements with the director of undergraduate studies before the end of their third year and to register for one quarter of MENG 29700 Undergraduate Research for Molecular Engineering during their third or fourth years. To be eligible to receive honors, students in the BS degree program must write a creditable honors paper describing their research. The paper must be submitted before the deadline established by the director of undergraduate studies and must be approved by the department chairperson. In addition, an oral presentation of the research is required. The research paper or project used to meet this requirement may not be used to meet the BA/BS paper or project requirement in another major. To earn a BS degree with honors in Molecular Engineering, students must also have an overall GPA of 3.0 or higher. Molecular Engineering Courses MENG 20000.

MLAP31200|Mon : 06:30 PM-09:30 PM|Natsci-1: Darwinian Medicine|[]|Arranged ARR|Open|Human beings, like other living organisms, are products of evolution and natural selection. Disease is a major factor in evolution; individuals who are relatively resistant to disease are the ones who survive and reproduce, and who transmit their genes to the next generation. Throughout most of human history, nutritional deficiencies and infectious diseases were probably the major cause of infant and childhood mortality and thus were important factors in natural selection in humans. Culture has greatly altered the human environment, providing us with new but sometimes toxic foods, exposing us to new infectious diseases, and creating other conditions for which our evolutionary heritage has poorly prepared us. We will examine the evolutionary principles and genetic mechanisms that inform our understanding of disease and will discuss the interplay between biological and cultural factors in the etiology of disease.|Robert Perlman|[40719]|1|Graduate|SEM

MPCS51040|Mon : 05:30 PM-08:30 PM|C Programming|[]|TBA|Open|This is an accelerated introduction to the C (not C++) Programming Language designed for students with prior programming experience. C is in many ways the lingua franca of computing, and a broad range of programming languages and related technologies derive from the basic principles of C memory management, control flow, and abstraction. Though there are many subtleties, C is not a big language, and it is expected that students will leave the course with a relatively deep understanding of the key concepts, which will then form a solid foundation for studying higher-level technologies. At the same time, C itself remains a very practical language, particularly so in areas such as scientific programming, high-performance computing, application level library design, systems programming, network programming, multi-threaded programming, etc. Students who successfully complete the course will be well prepared for subsequent MPCS courses in these areas. The course studies both fundamental and advanced C language constructs in the abstract and reinforces them through a range of exercies in the design of basic and advanced data structures, rudiemntary algorithms, and API design.|Dries Kimpe|[42983]|1|Graduate|LEC

MPCS51083|Thu : 05:30 PM-08:30 PM|Cloud Computing|[]|TBA|Open|Cloud computing is being widely adopted by enterprises of all sizes due to the low initial investment required, attractive operating costs, and elastic capacity that can best serve the highly variable demands of modern applications. Software engineers must be familiar with cloud computing technologies since many new applications they develop will be deployed “in the cloud”, and existing applications will often require integration with cloud-hosted services to take advantage of new capabilities. This course provides an introduction to cloud computing with specific consideration for application development in two contexts: highly scalable (or so-called “web-scale”) web applications, and enterprise applications in a hybrid environment comprising both on-premises and cloud infrastructure. We will focus primarily on infrastructure and platform services, and will introduce software-as-a-service from the perspective of a consuming application. The course will emphasize practical applications of cloud computing technologies, with sufficient exploration of their theoretical underpinnings to inform architectural, design, and implementation decisions.|Vas Vasiliadis|[42987]|1|Graduate|LEC

MPCS53001|Thu : 05:30 PM-08:30 PM|Databases|[]|TBA|Open|Students will learn database design and development and will build a simple but complete web application powered by a relational database. We start by showing how to model relational databases using the prevailing technique for conceptual modeling -- Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD). Concepts covered include entity sets and relationships, entity key as a unique identifier for each object in an entity set, one-one, many-one, and many-many relationships as well as translational rules from conceptual modeling (ERD) to relational table definitions. We also examine the relational model and functional dependencies and their application to the methods for improving database design: normal forms and normalization. After design and modeling, students will learn the universal language of relational databases: SQL (Structured Query Language). We start by introducing relational algebra -- the theoretical foundation of SQL. Then we examine in detail the two aspects of SQL: data definition language (DDL) and the data manipulation language (DML). Concepts covered include subqueries (correlated and uncorrelated), aggregation, various types of joins including outer joins and syntax alternatives. Students will gain significant experience with writing and reading SQL queries throughout the course in the detailed discussions in class, online homework, and the real-world individual project.|Zachary Freeman|[42990]|1|Graduate|LEC

MPCS55001|Tue : 05:30 PM-08:30 PM|Algorithms|[]|TBA|Open|The course is an introduction to the design and analysis of efficient algorithms, with emphasis on developing techniques for the design and rigorous analysis of algorithms rather than on implementation. Algorithmic problems include sorting and searching, discrete optimization, and algorithmic graph theory. Design techniques include divide-and-conquer methods, dynamic programming, greedy methods, graph search, as well as the design of efficient data structures. Methods of algorithm analysis include asymptotic notation, evaluation of recurrences, and the concepts of polynomial-time algorithms. NP-completeness is introduced toward the end the course. Students who complete the course will have demonstrated the ability to use divide-and-conquer methods, dynamic programming methods, and greedy methods, when an algorithmic design problem calls for such a method. They will have learned the design strategies employed by the major sorting algorithms and the major graph algorithms, and will have demonstrated the ability to use these design strategies or modify such algorithms to solve algorithm problems when appropriate. They will have derived and solved recurrences describing the performance of divide-and-conquer algorithms, have analyzed the time and space complexity of dynamic programming algorithms, and have analyzed the efficiency of the major graph algorithms, using asymptotic analysis.|Geraldine Brady|[42993]|1|Graduate|LEC

They can be used to model phenomena in a broad range of disciplines, including science/engineering (e.g. computational physics, chemistry, and biology), business/finance (e.g. investment models and operations research), and computer systems (e.g. client/server workloads and resilience modeling). In many cases relatively simple stochastic simulations can provide estimates for problems that are difficult or impossible to model with closed-form equations. In this class we focus on the rudimentary ideas and techniques that underlie stochastic time series analysis, discrete events modeling, and Monte Carlo simulations. Course lectures will focus on the basic principles of probability theory, their efficient implementation on modern computers, and examples of their application to real world problems. Upon completion of the course, students should have an adequate background to quickly learn in depth specific Monte Carlo approaches in their chosen field of interest.|Andrew Siegel|[54832]|1|Graduate|LEC

MUSI22517|Tue Thu : 03:00 PM-04:20 PM|Beethoven or Bust:  Musical Canon-Building in 19th Century Culture|[]|Goodspeed Hall 205|Open|The canon—a roster of composers, pieces, or artists elevated to the status of timeless classics—often serves as an invisible backdrop to musical life. But how do hierarchies of value form in the first place? This course explores how canons crystallized in nineteenth-century Europe (with topics such as monumentality, art-religion, and highbrow/lowbrow) and how this history has left traces in arts culture today (such as debates over Venezuela’s El Sistema, culture wars, and the “great books” that have shaped the UChicago Core). While canons have been the subject of heated debate in the humanities, the central aim of this course is not polemical but cultural-historical: to understand how values take root, by whom (and for whom) they are cultivated, and the ideas or actions that give them such extraordinary staying-power.|Abigail Fine|[53259]|1|Undergraduate|LEC

While the genre is one often denigrated as staging lyrical utopias of Romance and adventure allowing audiences to escape depressing quotidian realities, many musicals did seek to engage some of the most pressing social issues of their day. In this course, we will look—and listen—closely to four differing musicals from the 20th century, studying their creative origins, while also analyzing their complex social meanings revealed through the story, music, lyrics, staging, and dance. Musicals to be covered: Show Boat (1927), Oklahoma! (1943), My Fair Lady (1953), and Company (1970).

Readings drawn from the current theoretical literature will introduce students to a range of analytical methods, most of which fall outside the purview of the “canonical” graduate music analysis classes in the music curriculum (i.e., Music 31100–31300). In our weekly analytical work we will seek a balance between comparative breadth—drawing on multiple analytical methods—and mastery of specific analytical techniques. Our aim will be to embrace plural methodologies while at the same time honing our critical and evaluative capacities; indeed, we will be especially interested in exploring the status of analytical validity and “criteria of correctness” (Dunsby) in a pluralistic methodological field. Another central theme will be the “multimedia” of academic music analysis: the interaction of sound, text, image, and performance in the effective communication of analytical insight. Repertories addressed will include early music, non-Western repertories (centering especially on the recent work of Tenzer, Roeder, et al), and popular music, in addition to more familiar common-practice fare. Coursework will involve weekly analytical assignments, presentations, and a final paper.|Steven Rings|[53265]|1|Graduate|SEM

NEHC20155|Tue Thu : 10:30 AM-11:50 AM|A Political History of the Ancient Kingdom of Greater Armenia (ca. 188 BCE – 428 CE)|[]|TBA|Open|Generally speaking, the ancient kingdom of Great Armenia is a marginal entity within the fields of ancient history and archaeology, which attracted relatively few historians of antiquity. As a matter of fact, scholars of Antiquity usually refer to Armenia only when it was involved into one of the frequent military crises between East and West. The country had an important strategic position, a vast expanse of territory, and wealthy natural resources. This explains very well the efforts of the Seleucids and of Rome, and of the Iranian dynasties of the Parthians and the Sassanids, to establish a military control and cultural influence over Armenia. Both contacts with the West and the East shaped the complex identity of Armenia - a somewhat mixed identity which is rather difficult to study. Therefore, both Classical and Iranian scholars tend to neglect the role of Armenia, or to diminish its position in the balance of power: the anachronistic cliché of a Greater Armenia as a «buffer state» is still mentioned. Accordingly, the few specialists on pre-Christian Armenia hardly communicate with those other scholars. Therefore, the very marginality of the kingdom of Armenia has not stimulated neither Classical scholars, nor Iranian scholars, to show interest in Armenia as well. This course will present a comprehensive history of ancient Armenia, from its origins to the fall of the kingdom in 428 CE, in order to reconstruct the history of the Artaxiad and of the Arsacid dynasties within a geopolitical frame considering the role of Armenia between Rome and Iran.”|Giusto Traina|[43169]|1|Undergraduate|SEM
NEHC20287|Tue Thu : 09:00 AM-10:20 AM|Egypt in Late Antiquity|[]|TBA|Open|Egypt in Late Antiquity was a melting pot of cultures, languages, and religions. With the native Egyptians subject to a series of foreign masters (Greek and Roman), each with their own languages and religious practices, Egyptian society was marked by a rich and richly documented diversity. In this course we will pay special attention to the contact of languages and of religions, discussing on the basis of primary sources in translation different aspects characteristic of this period: the crises of the Roman Empire and their effects in Egypt, the emergence of Christianity and the decline of paganism, the development of monastic communities. The course will end at the Islamic conquest.|Sofia Torallas-Tovar|[54375]|1|Undergraduate|LEC

Beginning with the reception of Ancient Mesopotamian culture in late antiquity, the class will focus on the development of Syriac Christian, Rabbinic, and early Muslim sacred literatures in relation to the social, political, and economic contexts of the Roman and Iranian empires and inter-imperial Arabia. It will then turn to the literary and intellectual revival of the early Islamic caliphates, in which representatives of all three religions participated. Among the works to be read in translation are the Acts of Thomas, the Babylonian Talmud, the Qur’ān, and early Arabic poetry.|Richard Payne|[54380]|1|Undergraduate|LEC

What does a scandal tell us about the public that consumes and disseminates it? In this course, we tackle these questions through an investigation of some the major scandals of the early modern and modern periods in both Europe and the Middle East. From courtroom dramas in Paris and London to fierce debates in coffee houses and newspapers in Cairo, Beirut, and Istanbul, this course offers a comparative view of how scandals were disseminated, received, and narrativized across time and space. In doing so, we will also examine the central role of the ""public"" both as a concept and as an actor in early modern and modern scandals. The course will also introduce students to a wide variety of primary sources as well as a rich literature on the subject. All readings are in English. No prior background on the subject is required."|Basil Salem|[42898]|1|Undergraduate|SEM
NEHC20573|Mon Wed : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM|The Burden of History: The Nation and Its Lost Paradise|[]|Foster Hall 408|Open|How and why do national identities provoke the deep emotional attachments that they do? In this course we try to understand these emotional attachments by examining the narrative of loss and redemption through which most nations in the Balkans retell their Ottoman past. We begin by considering the mythic temporality of the Romantic national narrative while focusing on specific national literary texts where the national past is retold through the formula of original wholeness, foreign invasion, Passion, and Salvation. We then proceed to unpack the structural role of the different elements of that narrative. With the help of Žižek’s theory of the subject as constituted by trauma, we think about the national fixation on the trauma of loss, and the role of trauma in the formation of national consciousness. Specific theme inquiries involve the figure of the Janissary as self and other, brotherhood and fratricide, and the writing of the national trauma on the individual physical body. Special attention is given to the general aesthetic of victimhood, the casting of the victimized national self as the object of the “other’s perverse desire.” With the help of Freud, Žižek, and Kant we consider the transformation of national victimhood into the sublimity of the national self. The main primary texts include Petar Njegoš’ Mountain Wreath (Serbia and Montenegro), Ismail Kadare’s The Castle (Albania), Anton Donchev’s Time of Parting (Bulgaria).|Angelina Ilieva|[42378]|1|Undergraduate|LEC

NEHC20647|Tue Thu : 10:30 AM-11:50 AM|Islamic Political Thought in the Global Era||TBA|Open|This course examines the trajectory of Islamic political thought from the nineteenth century to the present day. Through a close study of key texts in this tradition, we will investigate how Islam has remained a vital source of principles and doctrines for a diverse array of political thinkers and movements over the course of the past two centuries. Developments in Islamic thought will be considered in the context of global trends, from the rise of liberalism, nationalism, and socialism to the liberation movements of the twentieth century and the confusion sewn by humanitarian crises of an unprecedented scale. Amidst these dramatic shifts in the geopolitical landscape, how have Muslim thinkers sought to ground their demands for dignity, autonomy, justice, and recognition? What do such claims have to do with the pursuit of personal and collective piety, on the one hand, and spiritual transcendence, on the other? Rather than framing Muslim political thinkers as reacting to global modernity, we understand them as key actors in shaping it, and our study of their writings will be oriented toward achieving a better understanding of the modern era as a whole. Our primary readings will take us from Istanbul, London, and the Nile Delta to Chicago, Tehran, and beyond, while our secondary texts will offer historical background and theoretical and theological context for the thinkers we focus on. The course aims to equip students to explore the Islamic tradition of political thought on their own. All required readings will be made available in English; the ability to read texts in their original languages of authorship (Arabic, Persian, Turkish, Urdu, French, etc.) is useful but not necessary. Some familiarity with the history of the modern Middle East and modern political thought is certainly helpful, but is not required.|Madeleine Elfenbein|[43157]|1|Undergraduate|LEC
