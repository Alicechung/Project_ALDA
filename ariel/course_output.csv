This course examines such arguments in relation to the pervasive evidence that magicality persists around precisely those sites most intimately associated with modernity's rationality and progress: the market, science and technology, and the state.

ANCM44916|Graduate|Open|Wed : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|"How do we know what we know about ancient religions? Historians of religion often begin by turning to texts: either sacred texts, or, in the absence of such scriptures, descriptions of belief and practice by observers from outside the faith. Archaeologists focus their attention on the spaces and traces of religious practice—or at least those that survive—while art historians begin by examining images of deities and religious rites. Yet we often fail to see the extent to which the questions which we ask of all of these diverse sources are conditioned by Christian rhetoric about pagan worship. In this course, we compare two moments when Christians encountered ""pagans"": during the initial Christian construction of a discourse on paganism (and, more broadly, a discourse on religion) during the late Roman empire and during the Spanish discovery of the New World. Our course examines silences and absences in the textual and material records, as well as the divergences between texts and objects, in order to further our understanding of ancient religious practice. We will begin to see the many ways in which, as scholars of religion, we are in effect still Christian theologians, paving the way for new approaches to the study of ancient religion."|Clifford Ando, Claudia Brittenham|Regenstein Library 207|The Discovery of Paganism|1|[43840]|[]|SEM

ANTH20702|Undergraduate|Open|Mon Wed : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM|The second segment of the African Civilizations sequence uses anthropological perspectives to investigate colonial and postcolonial encounters in West and East Africa. The course objective is to show that while colonialism was brutal and oppressive, it was by no means a unidirectional process of domination in which Europeans plundered the African continent and enforced a wholesale adoption of European culture. Rather, scholars today recognize that colonial encounters were complex culture, political, and economic fields of interaction. Africans actively adopted, reworked, and contested colonizers' policies and projects, and Europeans drew heavily from these encounters to form liberal conceptions of self, nation, and society. Over the course of the quarter, students will learn about forms of personhood, political economy, and everyday life in the twentieth century. Course themes will include social reproduction, kinship practices, medicine, domesticity, and development.

It is at once constraint and enabler, relational and personal, “real” and “imagined.” It is both individually performed and socially determined, the site of both domination and resistance. Anthropological theory has moved far from “Cartesian dualism” in which mind and body can and must be separate; this course will travel through ways of understanding bodies that have supplemented or bypassed this idea, or have existed outside of it entirely. We will consider what it means to have a body, to know a body, to be defined by a body – in short, to live a body. This class’s topical readings are oriented around the idea that “embodiment” involves both material entities and socially embedded processes. We will consider experience, consciousness, sensation, perception, and affect; we will interrogate processes, functions, and ways of knowing that are often taken for granted; we will prise apart the ways power is inscribed on and with bodies, both internally and externally. To do so, we will balance theory and ethnography in both our consumption and production of scholarly material., including a final ""auto-ethnography"" in which students adopt a new body practice for the quarter."|Andrea Ford|Haskell Hall 315|The Lived Body: Anthropology, Materiality & Meaningful Practice|1|[43391]|[]|SEM

ANTH23091|Undergraduate|Open|Tue Thu : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM|“Progress,” and its derived concept of “development” have puzzled Latin Americans throughout their modern history: they were an ambitious goal and a challenge for intellectual and political elites, a reality and an elusive dream for ordinary Latin Americans, and the cause of new challenges and problems wherever they actually or presumably took place. For historians, progress and development used to represent the very sense of universal history, a narrative that sneaked into visions of “Western modernity” and “globalization.” But later on, they became a myth to debunk rather than an object of reflection. What has “progress” meant particularly for Latin Americans? What is, for instance, the meaning of “progress” in the Brazilian flag? How did those notions shape the one of “development” since WWII? In political terms, what ideas of “progress” and “development” animated oligarchic, liberal, populist, military, revolutionary, and democratic projects across the region? Because both concepts involve planning and envisioning the outcome of present actions, the history of progress and development is also, in a certain way, a history of the future. The goal of this seminar is to help students situate a problem of their choice and trace its history in terms of the political debates that pursued the goal of progress and development in that specific realm.|Pablo Palomino|Psychology K114|Progress and Development in Latin America|1|[41612]|[]|LEC

It asks how these categories are constituted, by whom, and with what consequence. How do they define the contours of political community, the possibilities for empathy and understanding or the limits of rights and moral obligation? The historical and contemporary texts assigned draw attention to the layered and shifting meanings of these categories, and in turn to the geopolitical and epistomological worlds that give rise to them. By putting these texts into conversation with each other the course engages a number of key issues that have occupied social theorists: the relationship between power and knowledge, the politics of representation, and the nature of social theory more generally.|Yaqub Hilal|TBA|Rethinking the Middle East|1|[54395]|[]|SEM

In addition, given the ongoing problematic of “how to represent mental illness,” students will also have the opportunity to think through the different ways of presenting their analysis, both in the form of weekly blog entries and during a final-week mock-workshop, where they will showcase their work in a creative medium appropriate to that analysis.|Francis McKay|Saieh Hall for Economics 247|Experiencing Madness: Empathic Methods in Cultural Psychiatry|1|[54360]|[]|SEM

ANTH25440|Undergraduate|Open|Tue : 09:00 AM-11:50 AM|What are the cultural dimensions of economic and financial institutions and financial action? What social variables influence and shape 'real' markets and market activities? 'If you are so smart, why aren't you rich?' is a question economists have been asked in the past. Why isn't it easy to make money in financial areas even if one knows what economists know about markets, finance and the economy? And why, on the hand, is it so easy to get rich for some participants? Perhaps the answer is the real markets are complex social and cultural institutions which are quite different form organizations, administrations and the production side of the economy. The course provides an overview over social and cultural variables and patterns that play a role in economic behavior and specifically in financial markets. The readings examine the historical and structural embeddedness of economic action and institutions, the different constructions and interpretations of money, prices, and other dimensions of a market economy, and how a financial economy affects organizations, the art and other areas.|Karin Knorr Cetina|Haskell Hall M102|Maverick Markets:  Cultural Economy and Cultural Finance|1|[54365]|[]|SEM

ANTH34201|Graduate|Open|Tue Thu : 10:30 AM-11:50 AM|Systems II examines the development of key concepts in anthropology since the discipline’s institutionalization in the early 20th century. The course takes a genealogical approach to “anthropological theory” by tracking the formation, uptake and entailment's of different problem-spaces in anthropology—that is, the distinct complex of questions-and-answers around key themes and problems, which animate the discipline’s various modes of knowledge production. The course takes seriously the interplay of ethnographic inquiry and theory building and of professional practice and public engagement in the development of anthropology as a modern (and postmodern) discipline. While many of the concepts explored here will be recognizable as part of the “bread and butter” of anthropological research, the course is less interested in providing a comprehensive survey of 20th century anthropology than in interrogating the discipline’s signature style of theory building through ethnographic engagements in “the field.” We start from the premise that anthropological theory is a dialectical practice through which realist arguments about the historical world(s)—and the human’s place in it—are honed through empirical encounters and pushback from anthropology’s ethnographic subjects. Ultimately, the course hopes to track how anthropological ways of knowing intervene in the world through the making and stabilizing of particular lived concepts; that is, we ask after theory’s historical formation and durable effects, its social life, as well as afterlives, in the discipline and beyond.|Julie Chu|Wilder House 101|Develop Social Cultural Thry-1|1|[43427]|[]|SEM

Students will examine the theoretical and methodological groundings of cultural psychiatry, examining how scholars working in the phenomenological tradition have tried to describe the lived experiences of various forms of “psychopathology” or “madness.” By the end of the course, students will have learned how to describe and analyze the social dimension of a mental health experience, using a phenomenologically-grounded anthropological approach, and by adopting a technical vocabulary for understanding the lived experiences of mental illness (for instance, phenomena, life-world, being-in-the-world, intentionality, epoché, embodiment, madness, psychopathology, melancholia/depression, schizophrenia, etc). In addition, given the ongoing problematic of “how to represent mental illness,” students will also have the opportunity to think through the different ways of presenting their analysis, both in the form of weekly blog entries and during a final-week mock-workshop, where they will showcase their work in a creative medium appropriate to that analysis.|Francis McKay|Saieh Hall for Economics 247|Experiencing Madness: Empathic Methods in Cultural Psychiatry|1|[54361]|[]|SEM

ANTH40350|Graduate|Closed|Wed : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|Over recent decades research in the life sciences has increasingly drawn attention to the ways in which processes taking place outside “the body proper” profoundly shape the materializations of health and illness. Rather than understanding brains or genes as determinative and relatively immutable templates for human bodies and behaviors, researchers working on neuroplasticity and epigenetics have increasingly focused on understanding how social and material environments and experiences “get under the skin.” While many social scientists have welcomed these developments as validating long-held views about the social determination of health and illness, others have warned these seemingly paradigmatic shifts may only lead to new forms of reductionism. Perhaps most fundamentally, such emergent research has been described as the grounds for a renewed biosocial research agenda or for the rethinking of interdisciplinary work between the life and social sciences. This course traces both the discussions and their historical background, addressing topics including: the nature/culture distinction in anthropology, conceptualizations of “plasticity,” “development,” and “heredity” in the life and social sciences, and the forms of interdisciplinary exchange and conversation which biosocial research may require.|Eugene Raikhel|TBA|Assembling the Biosocial|1|[43241]|[]|SEM

ANTH58205|Graduate|Closed|Thu : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|Materiality is on everyone’s lips these days. Literatures across the disciplines are full of living bodies and concrete experiences, object biographies, ‘theories of things,’ a return to ‘matter,’ ‘new’ materialisms spun out of ‘old’ ones… While generative, materiality’s ubiquity also betrays a gap, an ambiguity, an absence. For what materiality is exactly remains unsure. Some seem to use it as a descriptive shorthand for the material world. Others as an analytic tending to the materialness of existence. Or as a discourse on it. For others still, it denotes the tangible effects of actions, practice, signs, and thought. Or a framework for unpacking the relationships mediating between people and things… Conjurations abound, yet seldom escape a certain circularity (“materiality studies… materiality?”). The concept has been used to frame a near infinite horizon of topics, from artefacts, of course, to cosmology, faith, finance, and absence, encompassing phenomena both enduring and ephemeral, both there and not-there. In taking on so much, has materiality outlasted its usefulness? What analytic work did it perform in the first place? With these considerations as background, through classic and recent literatures, this seminar will examine the relevance of ‘materiality’ (epistemologically, conceptually, methodologically) to anthropologies of the contemporary world, at a time when the ontologies of old are dissolving into a bubbling landscape of mixtures, hybridities, and post-humanities, which forces us to rethink basic questions of identity, agency, ethics and politics.|Francois Richard|TBA|Materiality|1|[43532]|[]|SEM

ARTH14107|Undergraduate|Open|Mon Wed : 03:00 PM-04:20 PM|This course will survey the art and archaeology of ancient Greece from ca. 1000 BCE–ca. 200 BCE. Participants will see the Greeks emerge from poverty and anarchy to form a distinctive political and social system based on city-states—and they will see that system grow unstable and collapse. They will see the emergence of distinctive forms of sculpture, architecture, pottery, and urban design—many of which are still in use today. Along with these facts, they will acquire a conceptual toolkit for looking at works of art and for thinking about the relation of art to social life.

By focusing on these urban gathering sites, this course explores a range of key historical moments in which different formations of the city square emerge (political, communal, royal, imperial, colonial, modernist, privatized, etc.) Its goal is to define a set of criteria for analyzing what constitutes a city square, how “public space” also has a history, how public monuments function over time, and how understanding the urban environment is always dependent on the intimate relationship between physical structures and spatial performances. It will consider, therefore, both the design morphology and the social configurations that infuse such spaces with meaning in any given context.|Niall Atkinson|Cochrane-Woods Art Ctr 156|Between the Agora and the Shopping Mall|1|[53360]|[]|SEM

ARTH23802|Undergraduate|Open|Thu : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|The processes, techniques, and formats for making and presenting photographs have evolved continuously since photography’s public debut in 1839. This course provides an introduction to the dynamic appearances of photographs through history. Rather than focusing on questions of style and subject matter, we will explore the visual “syntax” of photographic prints, exploring how the material aspects of their making can shape, alter, or determine meaning. Using materials from the Art Institute of Chicago’s Photography Collection, we will learn how to identify various kinds of photographic objects based on their visual and material attributes, building on that knowledge as a basis for art historical analysis, connoisseurship, and conservation. The course will follow a loose chronological structure, starting with early daguerreotypes and salted paper prints and ending with contemporary color and digital techniques. Along the way, we will consider: what makes photography a unified “medium”? How do the technical and aesthetic traditions of photography interact with one another? What makes some processes better suited to certain purposes than others? What variables do photographers consider while choosing a process or format? How have the changing material and visual qualities of photographs influenced ideas about photography in a general sense?|Carl Fuldner|Cochrane-Woods Art Ctr 153|COSI: How Photographs Look|1|[54504]|[]|SEM

It is not designed to be a survey course, but rather a historical investigation of certain issues and developments. We will concentrate on the following: what has been said to happen to objects when they are uprooted and moved into the museum; how and why museums have changed display practices so as to get viewers to look at art in new ways; what artists have understood museums to represent and how they have responded to that understanding in their work and their display preferences. Though reference will be made to the contemporary art world, the focus will be on materials and case studies drawn from the French Revolution through the 1960s.

But it is as much a dogged search for objective grounds of expression and intelligibility amidst a sea of subjectivity: from Van Gogh's letters and Mallarme's poems to the new logical symbolism of Frege and the stream of consciousness of William James, the epoch saw an unprecedented effort to rationalize the private, the incommunicable, experience itself.

ARTH25940|Undergraduate|Open|Tue Thu : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM|This interdisciplinary seminar considers the idea of the artist as ethnographer in contemporary art and curatorial practice. Through lecture, screening and group discussions, we will trace the historical relationship between visual culture and the social sciences, uncovering how this has impacted ways of viewing objects, people and cultures within the Western tradition. Armed with this knowledge, we will consider how the ethnographer’s commitment to the study of Others has been challenged by an increasingly globalised and post-colonial world. We will explore questions of authority and subjectivity in ethnographic fieldwork. Finally, we will look to contemporary artworks and exhibitions that have reinvested in the image and practice of the ethnographer to uncover the politics and poetics of their work. You will be introduced to the practices of Brad Butler and Karen Mirza, Paulo Nazareth, Marine Hugonnier, Camille Henrot, Kapwani Kiwanga et. al.

It is not designed to be a survey course, but rather a historical investigation of certain issues and developments. We will concentrate on the following: what has been said to happen to objects when they are uprooted and moved into the museum; how and why museums have changed display practices so as to get viewers to look at art in new ways; what artists have understood museums to represent and how they have responded to that understanding in their work and their display preferences. Though reference will be made to the contemporary art world, the focus will be on materials and case studies drawn from the French Revolution through the 1960s. French, German, English, and American museums will be featured.|Martha Ward|Cochrane-Woods Art Ctr 156|Museums and Art|1|[54508]|[]|SEM

But it is as much a dogged search for objective grounds of expression and intelligibility amidst a sea of subjectivity: from Van Gogh's letters and Mallarme's poems to the new logical symbolism of Frege and the stream of consciousness of William James, the epoch saw an unprecedented effort to rationalize the private, the incommunicable, experience itself.

On ruins writing, we will read Thucydides, Pausanias from within antiquity, the Enlightenment responses to the destruction and archaeological rediscovery of Pompeii, Diderot, Simmel, Freud on the mind as levels of ruins (Rome) and the analysis as reconstructive archaeologist as well as on the novel Gradiva and the Acropolis, the Romantic obsession with ruins, and the firebombing in WWII. We will also consider the photographing of ruins, and passages from the best-known works on photography (Benjamin, Sontag, Ritchen, Fried, Azoulay). The goal is to see how ruin gazing, and its depictions (textual, imagistic, photographic, etc.) change from the ancients (Greek and Roman), to the Romantic use of ruins as a source of (pleasurable) melancholy, to the technological “advances” in targeting and decimating civilian populations that describe the Second Word War.|Jas Elsner, Francoise Meltzer|Regenstein Library 207|Ruins|1|[43836]|[]|SEM
ARTH40310|Graduate|Open|Wed : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|"How do we know what we know about ancient religions? Historians of religion often begin by turning to texts: either sacred texts, or, in the absence of such scriptures, descriptions of belief and practice by observers from outside the faith. Archaeologists focus their attention on the spaces and traces of religious practice—or at least those that survive—while art historians begin by examining images of deities and religious rites. Yet we often fail to see the extent to which the questions which we ask of all of these diverse sources are conditioned by Christian rhetoric about pagan worship. In this course, we compare two moments when Christians encountered ""pagans"": during the initial Christian construction of a discourse on paganism (and, more broadly, a discourse on religion) during the late Roman empire and during the Spanish discovery of the New World. Our course examines silences and absences in the textual and material records, as well as the divergences between texts and objects, in order to further our understanding of ancient religious practice. We will begin to see the many ways in which, as scholars of religion, we are in effect still Christian theologians, paving the way for new approaches to the study of ancient religion."|Clifford Ando, Claudia Brittenham|Regenstein Library 207|The Discovery of Paganism|1|[43841]|[]|SEM
ARTH41610|Graduate|Open|Mon : 06:00 PM-08:50 PM|Venice’s long-standing ties with the Byzantine Empire have left their visible trace in the city’s art and architecture and have had an equally strong impact on Venetian myth-making in the pre-modern period. Until today the appropriation of Byzantine style is especially evident in the church of Saint Mark the Evangelist, as well as in the decoration of less-well known medieval churches of the Venetian Lagoon. During the so-called Fourth Crusade, the Sack of Constantinople has led to large-scale pillaging of the Byzantine capital and the transfer to Venice of countless Byzantine artifacts, among them are liturgical items, reliquaries, icons, and architectural spoils. How were these artifacts employed in the Venetian Lagoon for religious and political ends after being disassociated from their original contexts? What transformations did they experience with regard to usage and appearance? What kinds of new ceremonies, both religious and secular, did they inspire? What was their impact on artistic creativity and religious life in their new environment? How were they perceived intellectually, and what kinds of narratives evolved around them in Venice over the centuries? These are some of the key questions to guide our research. On a broader scale, we will investigate various phenomena of cultural transfer and ‘hybridity’ from the Middle Ages to the Baroque era.|Karin Krause|Swift Hall 201|Between East and West: Venice in the Pre-Modern Period|1|[41404]|[]|SEM

ARTH48201|Graduate|Open|Tue : 03:00 PM-05:50 PM|The site of some of the most widely recognizable monuments of western art history and the home to some of the most famous artists, writers, designers, thinkers, and cultural patrons of early modern culture, Florence has long occupied a central place in a larger pan-European discourse of Modernity, Beauty, and the Individual Subject. As a result, the city itself has come to occupy a mythic position as a central hub of Western intellectual culture: uprooted from its geographical specificity by the circulation of such proper names as Machiavelli, Leonardo, Michelangelo, and unmoored from its historical heritage by the disorienting complexities of modern mass tourism. Therefore, this course seeks to re-integrate the “Renaissance” into the urban context from which it emerged, to defamiliarize it so that it can be looked at from other perspectives. It focuses on the city itself as the protagonist of some of the most important experiments in art, architecture, and urban development and shows how they were intimately connected to a lively and engaged social body. By approaching images and monuments through the spatial practices by which they were encountered by Renaissance society (rituals of conflict, contests, economic exchange, religious devotion, urban politics, identity formation, among others), students will gain a more nuanced understanding of the links between a localized urban culture and a larger intercultural and cross-temporal exchange of ideas.|Niall Atkinson|Campus North Res Commons 158|Florentine Topographies: Art, Architecture, and Urban Life|1|[54588]|[]|SEM

This territory, commonly described as the ‘expanded field,’ involves not only art viewing contexts but also encompasses spaces of daily life and practice, socio-political spheres and draws regularly from non-art disciplines. The methods utilized in the production of this work are diverse and its successes are highly contested. In this studio-seminar course we will pack our proverbial bags and take a trip into this widely expanded field of socially engaged art and social practice, a practice emphasizing action, participation and dialogue. We will familiarize ourselves with numerous works, projects and methodologies that have been developed or proposed over the past 50 to 60 years, we will plunge deeply into the diverse historical frameworks leading up to and situating this work inside or outside art history and we will saturate our inquiries with the impassioned voices of this works’ supporters and skeptics through readings, blogs, interviews, field trips and visiting speakers.

ASTR12720|Undergraduate|Open|Mon Wed Fri : 10:30 AM-11:20 AM|The past two decades have witnessed the discovery of planets in orbit around other stars and the characterization of extra-Solar (exo-) planetary systems. We are now able to place our Solar System into the context of other worlds and a surprising conclusion that most planetary systems look nothing like our own. A challenging next step is to find planets as small as the Earth in orbit around stars like the Sun. The architecture of planetary systems reflects the formation of the parent star and its protoplanetary disk, and how these have changed with time. This course will review the techniques for discovery of planets around other stars, what we have learned so far about exoplanetary systems, and the driving questions for the future, including the quest for habitable environments elsewhere.

While wisdom has received less scholarly attention in modern times, it has recently re-emerged in popular discourse with a growing recognition of its potential importance for addressing complex issues in many domains. But what is wisdom? It’s often used with a meaning more akin to ""smart"" or ""clever."" Is it just vast knowledge? This course will examine the nature of wisdom—how it has been defined, how its meaning has changed, and what its essential components might be. We will examine how current psychological theories conceptualize wisdom and consider whether, and how, wisdom can be studied scientifically; that is, can wisdom be measured and experimentally manipulated to illuminate its underlying mechanisms and understand its functions? Finally, we will explore how concepts of wisdom can be applied in business, education, medicine, the law, and in the course of our everyday lives.

Worrying ourselves into the realm of the pathological, we now have a requisite measure of anxiety for every prescribed stage of life. But why are we so anxious? Considering its prevalence in everyday life, the concept and theories of anxiety have been employed surprisingly seldom as a way into film, fiction, and art. In this course we examine the modern origin of contemporary discourses specific to anxiety and their unique manifestation in cultural artifacts. To understand the complex of anxiety in the so-called Western world, we rely on the theories of Søren Kierkegaard, Martin Heidegger, Sigmund Freud, Jacques Lacan, and Alenka Zupančič; fiction by Stoker, Schnitzler, Kafka, and Sebald; and film by Haneke, Kubrick, Ophuls, and Hitchcock.

The clearest expression of its urges, of its battles, and, as Adorno would say, of its own contradictions. Catalunya is one of the most modern and European-like countries of the west. This desire for modernism is expressed in artists such as Salvador Dalí as well as the avant-garde daydreaming theater of La Fura dels Baus. In Catalunya, a small country, theater was the national defense during Franco’s dictatorship and in the present times serves as a nationalist weapon to claim independence. In this course, we will explore the history of Catalunya and Europe through theater, by means of written literature and footage of performances which will make lectures more dynamic and attractive. Also, we will meet the personal dramas of women and their social and historical implications through the theory of gender. Theater is a recreational and collective way of understanding a culture, thus it will be proposed to the students the possibility of creating a short play written and performed by them. Methodologically, the course is multifaceted and intertextual. The analysis tools are comparatist, historical, political, linguistic, psychiatric, and philosophical; the approach is creative (writing and acting) and related to cultural studies and feminism.

Over the course of the term, we will read literature on teaching and learning and use that scholarship to reflect on our own teaching practice. We will start at the beginning by thinking first about how people learn. Next we will turn our attention to course design and consider what kind of structure will help us promote learning in our students. We then consider assessment: how do we know students are learning, and how can the work we assign them promote meaningful engagement with course material? We will then think about what happens in the classroom by exploring different teaching methods, and what can be said for (and against) them. We will also consider the issue of inclusion in the classroom, discussing how to create a welcoming and productive classroom environment. Alongside this process of reading, reflection, and discussion, students will also be engaged in designing a course of their own. This endeavor will take the form of a course design project, which should serve as the foundation for a course you plan to teach soon, either in the College, at a Chicago-area institution, or in your first year as a faculty member.

We will also consider the photographing of ruins, and passages from the best-known works on photography (Benjamin, Sontag, Ritchen, Fried, Azoulay). The goal is to see how ruin gazing, and its depictions (textual, imagistic, photographic, etc.) change from the ancients (Greek and Roman), to the Romantic use of ruins as a source of (pleasurable) melancholy, to the technological “advances” in targeting and decimating civilian populations that describe the Second Word War.|Jas Elsner, Francoise Meltzer|Regenstein Library 207|Ruins|1|[43835]|[]|SEM
CDIN40301|Graduate|Open|Wed : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|"How do we know what we know about ancient religions? Historians of religion often begin by turning to texts: either sacred texts, or, in the absence of such scriptures, descriptions of belief and practice by observers from outside the faith. Archaeologists focus their attention on the spaces and traces of religious practice—or at least those that survive—while art historians begin by examining images of deities and religious rites. Yet we often fail to see the extent to which the questions which we ask of all of these diverse sources are conditioned by Christian rhetoric about pagan worship. In this course, we compare two moments when Christians encountered ""pagans"": during the initial Christian construction of a discourse on paganism (and, more broadly, a discourse on religion) during the late Roman empire and during the Spanish discovery of the New World. Our course examines silences and absences in the textual and material records, as well as the divergences between texts and objects, in order to further our understanding of ancient religious practice. We will begin to see the many ways in which, as scholars of religion, we are in effect still Christian theologians, paving the way for new approaches to the study of ancient religion."|Clifford Ando, Claudia Brittenham|Regenstein Library 207|The Discovery of Paganism|1|[43839]|[]|SEM

In the first part of class, we will focus on life course stage theory to understand the analytic construction of life course stages. In the second part of the course, we will explore current literature on the stalled transition to social adulthood in different socio-cultural contexts and critically examine the following “new” stages: “emerging adulthood” in the US and “waithood” in the Middle East. In the third part of the class, we will turn to futurity in order to understand the link between social adulthood and projects of future making.

As we critically examine psychological, sociological, and anthropological conceptions of emotion, we will aim to arrive at a comprehensive account of human emotions that neither sidelines the lived experience of emotions nor disregards their relationships to society and culture. Following a review of emotions across different disciplines in social sciences, we will visit the relationship between gender and emotion, development of emotions, and mental health and emotions.

CHDV21401|Undergraduate|Open|Mon Wed : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM|The second segment of the African Civilizations sequence uses anthropological perspectives to investigate colonial and postcolonial encounters in West and East Africa. The course objective is to show that while colonialism was brutal and oppressive, it was by no means a unidirectional process of domination in which Europeans plundered the African continent and enforced a wholesale adoption of European culture. Rather, scholars today recognize that colonial encounters were complex culture, political, and economic fields of interaction. Africans actively adopted, reworked, and contested colonizers' policies and projects, and Europeans drew heavily from these encounters to form liberal conceptions of self, nation, and society. Over the course of the quarter, students will learn about forms of personhood, political economy, and everyday life in the twentieth century. Course themes will include social reproduction, kinship practices, medicine, domesticity, and development.

Students will examine the theoretical and methodological groundings of cultural psychiatry, examining how scholars working in the phenomenological tradition have tried to describe the lived experiences of various forms of “psychopathology” or “madness.” By the end of the course, students will have learned how to describe and analyze the social dimension of a mental health experience, using a phenomenologically-grounded anthropological approach, and by adopting a technical vocabulary for understanding the lived experiences of mental illness (for instance, phenomena, life-world, being-in-the-world, intentionality, epoché, embodiment, madness, psychopathology, melancholia/depression, schizophrenia, etc). In addition, given the ongoing problematic of “how to represent mental illness,” students will also have the opportunity to think through the different ways of presenting their analysis, both in the form of weekly blog entries and during a final-week mock-workshop, where they will showcase their work in a creative medium appropriate to that analysis.|Francis McKay|Saieh Hall for Economics 247|Experiencing Madness: Empathic Methods in Cultural Psychiatry|1|[54362]|[]|SEM

CHDV40102|Graduate|Open|Tue : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|This course provides an in-depth discussion of selected topics in causal inference that are beyond what are covered in the introduction to causal inference course. The course is intended for graduate students and advanced undergraduate students who have taken the intro course and want to extend their knowledge in causal inference. Topics include (1) alternative matching methods, randomization inference for testing hypothesis and sensitivity analysis; (2) marginal structural models and structural nested models for time-varying treatment; (3) Rubin Causal Model (RCM) and Heckman’s scientific model of causality; (4) latent class treatment variable; (5) measurement error in the covariates; (6) the M-estimation for the standard error of the treatment effect for the use of IPW; (7) the local average treatment effect (LATE) and its problems, sensitivity analysis to examine the impact of plausible departure from the IV assumptions, and identification issues of multiple IVs for multiple/one treatments; (8) Multi-level data for treatment evaluation for multilevel experimental designs and observational designs, and spilt-over effect; (9) Nonignorable missingness and informative censoring issues.|Guanglei Hong, Kazuo Yamaguchi, Fan Yang|TBA|Advanced Topics in Causal Inference|1|[54840]|[]|SEM
CHDV40203|Graduate|Open|Mon Wed : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM|This research seminar is designed for graduate students who are eager to investigate how the Great Recession in the past decade has affected the life course trajectories of people, especially children and youth, in various demographic groups defined by the intersections of social class, race/ethnicity, gender, and urbanisity. Dramatic changes in the economic context have posed challenges to individuals, families, and communities to various degrees, which offer opportunities to revisit and possibly revise theories about human development. The class will raise big questions substantiated by the literature and will ask specific questions for empirical investigation. These questions will then evolve into research projects to be carried out collectively or individually through analyzing large-scale longitudinal data sets. The process will involve discussions of appropriate research designs, development of data analytic plans, and interpretations of empirical evidence. Throughout the course, students will receive hands-on training on how to write an empirical paper for an academic journal. Students are expected to produce single-authored or co-authored manuscripts at the end of the course. Pre-requisites for this course are at least one and preferably two applied statistics courses.|Guanglei Hong|TBA|Youth of the Great Recession|1|[43235]|[]|SEM
CHDV40772|Graduate|Open|Tue Thu : 04:30 PM-05:50 PM|In this seminar, we will examine the relationship between self and other. In order to develop a comprehensive account of this multifaceted and multiform relationship, we will critically investigate the relationship of self to different types of ‘others’ ranging from primary caregivers and society to immediate as well as distant and despised interlocutors. We will supplement this discussion with an inquiry into the possibility and limits of self without an other, and visit the question of how human consciousness differs from that of other primates. In the course of our discussions, we will critically engage issues concerning the development of the self, its unity, individuality, and agency, and the possibilities of creativity, resistance and the transformation of the self. By the end of the quarter, you are expected to develop a deeper understanding of the relationship between self and other.|Sevda Numanbayraktaroglu|Rosenwald Hall 329|Self and Other|1|[43257]|[]|SEM

CHDV43255|Graduate|Closed|Wed : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|Over recent decades research in the life sciences has increasingly drawn attention to the ways in which processes taking place outside “the body proper” profoundly shape the materializations of health and illness. Rather than understanding brains or genes as determinative and relatively immutable templates for human bodies and behaviors, researchers working on neuroplasticity and epigenetics have increasingly focused on understanding how social and material environments and experiences “get under the skin.” While many social scientists have welcomed these developments as validating long-held views about the social determination of health and illness, others have warned these seemingly paradigmatic shifts may only lead to new forms of reductionism. Perhaps most fundamentally, such emergent research has been described as the grounds for a renewed biosocial research agenda or for the rethinking of interdisciplinary work between the life and social sciences. This course traces both the discussions and their historical background, addressing topics including: the nature/culture distinction in anthropology, conceptualizations of “plasticity,” “development,” and “heredity” in the life and social sciences, and the forms of interdisciplinary exchange and conversation which biosocial research may require.|Eugene Raikhel|TBA|Assembling the Biosocial|1|[43240]|[]|SEM
CHDV44214|Graduate|Open|Tue : 09:00 AM-11:50 AM|From the day we are born til the day we die, we experience a gendered world that shapes our opportunities, our social interactions, and even our physical health and wellbeing. This course will provide an introduction to sociological perspectives on gender, physical and mental health, and medicine while also providing a deep interrogation of the social, institutional, and biological links between gender and health. We will discuss inequalities in morbidity, mortality, and health behaviors of women, men, and transgendered individuals from different race, ethnic, and class backgrounds, and we will use sociological concepts, theories, and methods to understand why these differences appear. Finally, we will examine how medicine as an institution and medical practices as organizations sometimes contribute to and combat gender inequality in health. By the end of the course, you will be familiar with social scientific perspectives on (1) gender, (2) mental and physical health, and (3) the practice of medicine, as well as some of the fundamental debates in current medical sociology and sociology of gender.|Anna Mueller|Rosenwald Hall 329|Gender, Health & Medicine|1|[43242]|[]|SEM

Students will examine the theoretical and methodological groundings of cultural psychiatry, examining how scholars working in the phenomenological tradition have tried to describe the lived experiences of various forms of “psychopathology” or “madness.” By the end of the course, students will have learned how to describe and analyze the social dimension of a mental health experience, using a phenomenologically-grounded anthropological approach, and by adopting a technical vocabulary for understanding the lived experiences of mental illness (for instance, phenomena, life-world, being-in-the-world, intentionality, epoché, embodiment, madness, psychopathology, melancholia/depression, schizophrenia, etc). In addition, given the ongoing problematic of “how to represent mental illness,” students will also have the opportunity to think through the different ways of presenting their analysis, both in the form of weekly blog entries and during a final-week mock-workshop, where they will showcase their work in a creative medium appropriate to that analysis.|Francis McKay|Saieh Hall for Economics 247|Experiencing Madness: Empathic Methods in Cultural Psychiatry|1|[53674]|[]|SEM

CHSS35506|Graduate|Open|Tue : 12:00 PM-02:50 PM|One can distinguish four ways in which science and aesthetics are related during the period since the Renaissance. First, science has been the subject of artistic representation, in painting and photography, in poetry and novels (e.g., in Byron’s poetry, for example). Second, science has been used to explain aesthetic effects (e.g., Helmholtz’s work on the way painters achieve visual effects or musicians achieve tonal effects). Third, aesthetic means have been used to convey scientific conceptions (e.g., through illustrations in scientific volumes or through aesthetically affective and effective writing). Finally, philosophers have stepped back to consider the relationship between scientific knowing and aesthetic comprehension (e.g., Kant, Bas van Fraassen); much of the discussion of this latter will focus on the relation between images and what they represent. In this lecture-discussion course we will consider all of these aspects of the science-aesthetic connection.|Robert Richards|TBA|Science and Aesthetics in the 18th-21st Centuries|1|[42919]|[]|SEM

CLAS44916|Graduate|Open|Wed : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|"How do we know what we know about ancient religions? Historians of religion often begin by turning to texts: either sacred texts, or, in the absence of such scriptures, descriptions of belief and practice by observers from outside the faith. Archaeologists focus their attention on the spaces and traces of religious practice—or at least those that survive—while art historians begin by examining images of deities and religious rites. Yet we often fail to see the extent to which the questions which we ask of all of these diverse sources are conditioned by Christian rhetoric about pagan worship. In this course, we compare two moments when Christians encountered ""pagans"": during the initial Christian construction of a discourse on paganism (and, more broadly, a discourse on religion) during the late Roman empire and during the Spanish discovery of the New World. Our course examines silences and absences in the textual and material records, as well as the divergences between texts and objects, in order to further our understanding of ancient religious practice. We will begin to see the many ways in which, as scholars of religion, we are in effect still Christian theologians, paving the way for new approaches to the study of ancient religion."|Clifford Ando, Claudia Brittenham|Regenstein Library 207|The Discovery of Paganism|1|[43842]|[]|SEM

CLCV21806|Undergraduate|Closed|TBA|This course will introduce students to Latin American film studies through an assessment of its most critically celebrated period of radical filmmaking. The New Latin American Cinema (NLAC) of the late 1950s-70s generated unprecedented international enthusiasm for Latin American film production. The filmmakers of this loosely designated movement were defining themselves in relation to global realist film traditions like Italian Neorealism and Griersonian documentary, in relation to--mostly failed-- experiments in building Hollywood-style national film industries, and in relation to regional discourses of underdevelopment and mestizaje. Since the late 1990s, a reassessment of the legacy of the NLAC has been taking shape as scholars have begun to interrogate its canonical status in the face of a changed political climate. In the sphere of filmmaking, contemporary Latin American new wave cinemas are also grappling with that legacy-sometimes disavowing it, sometimes appropriating it. We will situate the NLAC in its historical context, survey its formal achievements and political aspirations, assess its legacy, and take stock of the ways and the reasons that it haunts contemporary production.|Staff|TBA|The New Latin American Cinema and Its Afterlife|1|[53555]|[]|SEM

In this course, we will explore the fall of the Roman republic from a number of different angles: as a crisis experienced and vividly described by Cicero and his contemporaries, as a societal watershed that captured the imaginations of Rome’s literary giants (including Virgil, Lucan, and Tacitus), and as the failure of a political system based upon the principle of popular sovereignty. Through the close reading of Latin literature and the analysis of secondary scholarship, we will try to determine the significance that the demise of the republic held for contemporary Romans, as well as the significance that it continues to hold today.

From the earliest shatranj puzzles of the sixth-century to the chess schools of the Soviet Union, societies across the world have turned to the game for intellectual challenge and to sharpen mental acuity. As the quintessential activity of human reasoning, chess soon became a favorite subject for cognitive science research, yielding insights into search methods, memory, judgment, and problem-solving strategies. In this course, we will read select chess narratives in tandem with supplementary readings on cognition to understand the role of game playing in cultural imagination beyond metaphor. These supplementary readings will explore evaluative judgments, memory processes, and human perception, among other topics. We will examine various works of troubled genius, beginning with Vladimir Nabokov’s 1930 tale of chess and obsession, The Defense. Stefan Zweig’s own contribution in his 1941 Chess Story will round out our exploration of monomania and the tenuous boundaries of reason.

In this course we try to understand these emotional attachments by examining the narrative of loss and redemption through which most nations in the Balkans retell their Ottoman past. We begin by considering the mythic temporality of the Romantic national narrative while focusing on specific national literary texts where the national past is retold through the formula of original wholeness, foreign invasion, Passion, and Salvation. We then proceed to unpack the structural role of the different elements of that narrative. With the help of Žižek’s theory of the subject as constituted by trauma, we think about the national fixation on the trauma of loss, and the role of trauma in the formation of national consciousness. Specific theme inquiries involve the figure of the Janissary as self and other, brotherhood and fratricide, and the writing of the national trauma on the individual physical body. Special attention is given to the general aesthetic of victimhood, the casting of the victimized national self as the object of the “other’s perverse desire.” With the help of Freud, Žižek, and Kant we consider the transformation of national victimhood into the sublimity of the national self. The main primary texts include Petar Njegoš’ Mountain Wreath (Serbia and Montenegro), Ismail Kadare’s The Castle (Albania), Anton Donchev’s Time of Parting (Bulgaria).|Angelina Ilieva|Foster Hall 408|The Burden of History: The Nation and Its Lost Paradise|1|[42374]|[]|LEC

Mann began the novel under the Weimar Republic and continued working on the novel in exile. The writer himself saw his novel as an act of resistance to his country’s anti-Semitic policies. In this course, we will closely read the novel, explore its relation to its biblical and other sources, learn about the history of its writing and publication and contextualize its genesis in Mann’s complicated involvement with German and world politics.|Olga Solovieva|TBA|Thomas Mann's Joseph and His Brothers|1|[54349]|[]|SEM
CMLT25302|Undergraduate|Open|Thu : 03:00 PM-05:50 PM|The relationship between fashion and modernity has always been taken for granted. Indeed, it is guaranteed in the very etymology of the French and German words “mode” and “modernité”. Yet, on closer inspection, there is a blind spot in this relation in that fashion seems rather to be the Other of modernity than modernity itself, an Oriental colony in the heart of the West. The modern discourse of fashion testifies to the ambivalences and paradoxes in this relationship. From the beginning of the modern world until now, it is strangely split: there is fashion and fashion. Properly speaking, men’s fashion is not really fashionable. The perfectly functional suit without superfluous adornment is, in its world-wide constancy through the centuries, almost invariably classical. Its staggering universal success is due to the fact that it is the ideal modern dress: beautiful, because functional. Women’s fashion, on the contrary, is a remnant of the old, effeminate aristocracy – a frivolous frill, an all-in-all dysfunctional ornament, badly in need of thorough modernization. The „new woman“ is born in agonizing pain and perpetual fallbacks: while Chanel almost lead us toward a functional feminine form, Dior’s new look was, from this perspective, a setback: it brought back the unhealthy, restrictive corset and offered a slap in the face to the modern aesthetic dogma of „form follows function“. Fashion therefore seems to be the locus of a strange intimation of the political set against the common politics of modernity. By reading texts form Friedrich Nietzsche to Adolf Loos and Thorstein Veblen, Rousseau to Baudelaire, from Gautier, Zola and Apollinaire to Simone de Beauvoir and Pierre Bourdieu, the course will center around this blind spot between fashion and modernity and the new gendering of fashion in the bourgeois, post-feudal era.|Barbara Vinken|Classics Building 313|Fashion and Modernity|1|[53927]|[]|SEM
CMLT25702|Undergraduate|Open|Tue Thu : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM|This course serves as an introduction to Russian and European modernism, taking the fictionalized autobiography as its focus. In the early twentieth century the novel-memoir becomes arguably the foremost vehicle for literary modernism. We will examine the literary strategies used to represent the workings of memory and the construction of their autobiographical worlds. What role does tradition play in foregrounding the writers’ approach to their immediate familial and cultural past? How is the experience of time reconfigured by the processes of memory, and what rhetorical techniques are used to effect this in prose narratives? Readings may include James Joyce’s A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, Andrei Bely’s Kotik Letaev, Virginia Woolf’s To the Lighthouse, Osip Mandelshtam’s The Noise of Time and Vladimir Nabokov’s Speak, Memory, as well as selections from Boris Pasternak, Marcel Proust, Andrei Platonov, Marina Tsvetaeva and others. Supplementary readings will include texts by Sigmund Freud, Henri Bergson, Gérard Genette and Mikhail Bakhtin.

CMLT57100|Undergraduate|Open|Thu : 10:30 AM-01:20 PM|What happens to literary works whose authors think in more than one language, and allow that excess to be registered in their texts? While in an age of global migrations, multilingual speakers have come to outnumber the number of monolingual speakers, literary studies continue to privilege works aimed at a monolingual audience. This is particularly the case in the United States, where “English-only” attitudes have dominated discourse for over a century. This course instead explores literary works that take up residence in the space between two or more languages, whether national or regional—as well as those that attempt to dodge semantic systems altogether. From modernist collage and transense to contemporary poetry of exile, migration, and diaspora, the works we will study, lodged between tongues, lend nuance and fascination to debates surrounding “global literature” and untranslatability. We will examine the formal and social prompts and repercussions of experiments in polylingualism, barbarism, dialect, creole, and thwarted translation, and will delve into examples of the potential for mixed/new media poetics to accommodate multiple linguistic systems. While it is not at all necessary for students to be fluent in more than one language to take this course, some experience learning or attempting to learn languages beyond English is essential.

Like other classic Chicago general education courses, this sequence provides students with both practical programming skills and core ideas in computer science in interdisciplinary applications. Students learn how to perform in a multi-platform (Mac/Linux/Windows) environment using a high-level prototyping framework (LiveCode) that allows for the quick creation of useful “apps” for all platforms — mobile, tablet, and desktop. LiveCode is a free application that can be installed on student computers. As a classic Core course in the Chicago tradition, the course presents introductory techniques of problem solving, algorithm construction, program coding, and debugging as interdisciplinary arts adaptable to a wide range of disciplines with their specialized problems especially since programming is an integral part of almost all disciplines. The first course moves through a sequence from step-by-step introductory labs, to labs that require independent analysis and solution, to a student-designed final project.

CMST14509|Undergraduate|Open|Tue Thu : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM|The uncanny is an experience or quality that by definition remains difficult to grasp; something that is mysterious and enigmatic, yet also seems oddly familiar. It is an atmosphere, mood or perhaps a theme that movies have explores since nearly the beginning of cinema (or perhaps even before..) To explore this term this class will draw largely on a tradition of commentary on the German word Das Unheimliche, usually translated as uncanny, that can be traced among Ernst Jentsch, Sigmund Freud, and Martin Heidegger and its relevance to film studies. Freud and his disciple Otto Rank before 1920 related the uncanny to the cinema, and cinema’s ability to evoke the uncanny has been frequently observed. On the one hand, the cinema’s ability to portray uncanny events (as in Rank and Freud’s invocation of the 1913 film the Student in Prague) appears generically in films of fantasy or horror. In addition, some theorists have felt that film as a medium could be best approached via the uncanny. In this class, we will read a series of the key texts and try to survey the terrain of the concept of the uncanny. We will screen films that evoke the experience through their narrative and stylistics, and we will discuss the usefulness of the term for theorizing both film and electronic media, both new and old.|Thomas R Gunning|Logan Center 801|The Uncanny in Cinema|1|[43909]|[{'instructor': 'Gunning', 'sectionname': 'Section 1S01 [43910] - SCR Open', 'daytime': 'Wed : 07:00 PM-10:00 PM'}]|LEC

The New Latin American Cinema (NLAC) of the late 1950s-70s generated unprecedented international enthusiasm for Latin American film production. The filmmakers of this loosely designated movement were defining themselves in relation to global realist film traditions like Italian Neorealism and Griersonian documentary, in relation to--mostly failed-- experiments in building Hollywood-style national film industries, and in relation to regional discourses of underdevelopment and mestizaje. Since the late 1990s, a reassessment of the legacy of the NLAC has been taking shape as scholars have begun to interrogate its canonical status in the face of a changed political climate. In the sphere of filmmaking, contemporary Latin American new wave cinemas are also grappling with that legacy-sometimes disavowing it, sometimes appropriating it. We will situate the NLAC in its historical context, survey its formal achievements and political aspirations, assess its legacy, and take stock of the ways and the reasons that it haunts contemporary production.|Salome Skvirsky|Cobb Hall 311|The New Latin American Cinema and Its Afterlife|1|[43923]|[{'instructor': 'Skvirsky', 'sectionname': 'Section 1S01 [43924] - SCR Open', 'daytime': 'Thu : 03:30 PM-06:30 PM'}]|SEM

Each week we will engage with theoretical or analytical readings, through which we will explore 1) how particular ethics and politics are imbricated in various documentary modes and genres and 2) the specific cases of Japanese documentaries and their styles/techniques, measuring them against today’s media regime (and measuring that regime against them). Various traces of Japanese documentary filmmaking practice can be seen carried forward and extended in cinematic creations worldwide, from works by Chris Marker, Abbas Kiarostami and Wim Wenders to recent independent documentaries in East Asia. To locate such traces in the transnational framework, the final sections of the course will be devoted to China’s new documentary film movement since the 1990s and contemporary Taiwanese documentaries.|Takuya Tsunoda|Cobb Hall 307|(Re-)Presenting the Real:  Nonfiction Cinema in Japan and East Asia|1|[54725]|[{'instructor': 'Tsunoda', 'sectionname': 'Section 1S01 [54726] - SCR Open', 'daytime': 'Wed : 07:00 PM-10:00 PM'}]|LEC

He asked the question hanging in the minds of generations of filmmakers around the world, most likely including Lubitsch himself. In a career spanning nearly three decades, Lubitsch’s name has come to denote a style about style, first exported from Germany to Hollywood and then from Hollywood to the world. In this sense, Lubitsch is first and foremost a filmmaker for filmmakers, and his style decidedly an international one. It is the goal of this course to examine a broadly defined international stylistic history developed by and associated with Lubitsch, whose legacy cannot be adequately assessed without such a perspective. With dual emphases on formal and historical analyses, we will look at Lubitsch’s early Weimar comedy and epic films, American silent masterpieces, musicals, sound comedies, and political farces, as well as Lubitsch-esque films made in Japan, China, and France.|Xinyu Dong|Cobb Hall 310|Ernst Lubitsch:  An International Style|1|[43948]|[{'instructor': 'Staff', 'sectionname': 'Section 1S01 [43949] - SCR Open', 'daytime': 'Tue : 07:00 PM-10:00 PM'}]|LEC

It will explore historical and theoretical issues related to the mutual interactions between cinema and theatre also discussing cinematographic techniques in playwriting as exemplified in plays by Henrik Ibsen (e.g. Peer Gynt) and August Strindberg (e.g. A Dream Play and The Ghost Sonata). Throughout most of his creative career Bergman worked both in theatre and film and even if he is mostly known outside of Sweden as a film director, his theatrical career was as innovative. The work of the film-auteur and the theatre director are for Bergman closely connected, not only through the actors he worked with – during summers for the screen and during the theatre seasons in stage productions – but also through the choice of themes, which are often in direct dialogue with each other in the two media, generating complex meta-aesthetic, inter-medial discourses, depicting and problematizing the work and role of the artist in a broad range of social and ideological contexts.

CMST31806|Graduate|Open|Fri : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|This course will introduce students to Latin American film studies through an assessment of its most critically celebrated period of radical filmmaking. The New Latin American Cinema (NLAC) of the late 1950s-70s generated unprecedented international enthusiasm for Latin American film production. The filmmakers of this loosely designated movement were defining themselves in relation to global realist film traditions like Italian Neorealism and Griersonian documentary, in relation to--mostly failed-- experiments in building Hollywood-style national film industries, and in relation to regional discourses of underdevelopment and mestizaje. Since the late 1990s, a reassessment of the legacy of the NLAC has been taking shape as scholars have begun to interrogate its canonical status in the face of a changed political climate. In the sphere of filmmaking, contemporary Latin American new wave cinemas are also grappling with that legacy-sometimes disavowing it, sometimes appropriating it. We will situate the NLAC in its historical context, survey its formal achievements and political aspirations, assess its legacy, and take stock of the ways and the reasons that it haunts contemporary production.|Salome Skvirsky|Cobb Hall 311|The New Latin American Cinema and Its Afterlife|1|[43925]|[{'instructor': 'Skvirsky', 'sectionname': 'Section 1S01 [43926] - SCR Open', 'daytime': 'Thu : 03:30 PM-06:30 PM'}]|SEM

We will engage in rigorous examination of the transformations of cinematic forms and contents, and of the social, cultural and political elements bound up with those transformations. Over the quarter, you will also learn the tools necessary to analyze documentaries. The course assumes no prior knowledge of film or documentary theory. Each week we will engage with theoretical or analytical readings, through which we will explore 1) how particular ethics and politics are imbricated in various documentary modes and genres and 2) the specific cases of Japanese documentaries and their styles/techniques, measuring them against today’s media regime (and measuring that regime against them). Various traces of Japanese documentary filmmaking practice can be seen carried forward and extended in cinematic creations worldwide, from works by Chris Marker, Abbas Kiarostami and Wim Wenders to recent independent documentaries in East Asia. To locate such traces in the transnational framework, the final sections of the course will be devoted to China’s new documentary film movement since the 1990s and contemporary Taiwanese documentaries.|Takuya Tsunoda|Cobb Hall 307|(Re-)Presenting the Real:  Nonfiction Cinema in Japan and East Asia|1|[54727]|[{'instructor': 'Tsunoda', 'sectionname': 'Section 1S01 [54728] - SCR Open', 'daytime': 'Wed : 07:00 PM-10:00 PM'}]|LEC

We will then consider its influence on contemporary art cinema, from Aleksandr Sokurov and Béla Tarr to Nuri Bilge Ceylan and Alejandro González Iñárritu (Birdman). Along the way we will also consider the long-take style in documentary cinema, and will also consider the links between long-take cinema and certain tendencies in video art, exemplified by the work in video of Sharon Lockhart and James Benning. We will close by considering the feature films of artists Steve McQueen and Lucien Castaing-Taylor. Treating long-take style as a distinct approach to cinematic realism, in each case we will evaluate the claims made for the ethical, metaphysical and even political valences of the long take, with readings by filmmakers and by theorists from Henri Bergson and André Bazin to Gilles Deleuze, Jacques Rancière, Laura Mulvey and beyond.|Robert Bird|Cobb Hall 311|Long-Take Cinema|1|[43933]|[{'instructor': 'Staff', 'sectionname': 'Section 1S01 [43934] - SCR Open', 'daytime': 'Mon : 03:30 PM-06:30 PM'}]|LEC

He asked the question hanging in the minds of generations of filmmakers around the world, most likely including Lubitsch himself. In a career spanning nearly three decades, Lubitsch’s name has come to denote a style about style, first exported from Germany to Hollywood and then from Hollywood to the world. In this sense, Lubitsch is first and foremost a filmmaker for filmmakers, and his style decidedly an international one. It is the goal of this course to examine a broadly defined international stylistic history developed by and associated with Lubitsch, whose legacy cannot be adequately assessed without such a perspective. With dual emphases on formal and historical analyses, we will look at Lubitsch’s early Weimar comedy and epic films, American silent masterpieces, musicals, sound comedies, and political farces, as well as Lubitsch-esque films made in Japan, China, and France.|Xinyu Dong|Cobb Hall 310|Ernst Lubitsch:  An International Style|1|[43950]|[{'instructor': 'Staff', 'sectionname': 'Section 1S01 [43951] - SCR Open', 'daytime': 'Tue : 07:00 PM-10:00 PM'}]|LEC

It will explore historical and theoretical issues related to the mutual interactions between cinema and theatre also discussing cinematographic techniques in playwriting as exemplified in plays by Henrik Ibsen (e.g. Peer Gynt) and August Strindberg (e.g. A Dream Play and The Ghost Sonata). Throughout most of his creative career Bergman worked both in theatre and film and even if he is mostly known outside of Sweden as a film director, his theatrical career was as innovative. The work of the film-auteur and the theatre director are for Bergman closely connected, not only through the actors he worked with – during summers for the screen and during the theatre seasons in stage productions – but also through the choice of themes, which are often in direct dialogue with each other in the two media, generating complex meta-aesthetic, inter-medial discourses, depicting and problematizing the work and role of the artist in a broad range of social and ideological contexts.

CRES20802|Undergraduate|Open|Mon Wed : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM|The second segment of the African Civilizations sequence uses anthropological perspectives to investigate colonial and postcolonial encounters in West and East Africa. The course objective is to show that while colonialism was brutal and oppressive, it was by no means a unidirectional process of domination in which Europeans plundered the African continent and enforced a wholesale adoption of European culture. Rather, scholars today recognize that colonial encounters were complex culture, political, and economic fields of interaction. Africans actively adopted, reworked, and contested colonizers' policies and projects, and Europeans drew heavily from these encounters to form liberal conceptions of self, nation, and society. Over the course of the quarter, students will learn about forms of personhood, political economy, and everyday life in the twentieth century. Course themes will include social reproduction, kinship practices, medicine, domesticity, and development.

CRES24212|Undergraduate|Open|Tue Thu : 04:30 PM-05:50 PM|In 1971, the writer Tomás Rivera described the “Chicano renaissance” as a process of self-invention that involved the “exteriorization of our will”—an effort that motivated a “life in search of form.” This course will examine some of the most ambitious works of literature that are the result of this search. Our guiding inquiries will be simultaneously interpretive, theoretical, and historical: What does it mean to think of form as an “exteriorization” of one’s “will”? Whose will do these forms represent (who is the “us” in Rivera’s “our will”)? What representational strategies enable this exteriorization and dramatize its limitations? Why was the novel so often singled out, and why did some feminist writers prefer instead a collection of letters, poems, journal entries, and personal essays? These questions will inform our study of the consolidation of a self-conscious Chicago literature and its attendant literary history. Students of the course will therefore not only become familiar with exciting works of textual art, they will also study the institutional context that enables the consolidation of “a literature,” and a “literary history.” Authors will include José Antonio Villarreal, Tomás Rivera, Rudolfo Anaya, Cherríe Moraga, Ana Castillo, and Gloria Anzaldúa.

It begins with two basic premises: first, both the Japanese colonial authorities’ measures of repression, and the Korean responses to them, can be understood as noticeably more staunch and sophisticated when compared to any other region of the Empire; and second, the censorship practices in Korea offers itself as a case that is in itself an effective point of comparison to better understand other censorship operations in general and the impact of these operations across different regions. With a view to probing an inter- and intra-relationship between censorship practices among a variety of imperial/colonial regions, this course studies the institutions related to censorship, the human agents involved in censorship—both external and internal—and texts and translations that were produced in and outside of Korea, and were subject to censorship. Overall, the course stresses the importance of establishing a comparative understanding of the functions of censorship, and on the basis of this comparative thinking we will strive to conceptualize the characteristics of Japanese colonial censorship in Korea.|Kyeong-Hee Choi|Wieboldt Hall 301N|Censorship in East Asia:  The Case of Colonial Korea|1|[53788]|[]|SEM

CRES55300|Graduate|Open|Thu : 03:00 PM-05:50 PM|This course will trace the philosophical, juridical, and literary itinerary of modernity’s impossible subject: the person who enslaves himself. From Grotius to Vitoria through Hobbes and Locke up to Mill and beyond, the one thing that modernity’s self-possessive subject cannot will to alienate, sell, or give away is himself. From this perspective, slavery can only be a relation of domination or as a vanishing moment before the enslaved contracts into servitude. In the process of installing this perspective, philosophical modernity foreclosed myriad philosophical and legal traditions of self-enslavement at the precise moment that slavery itself was generalized as the Atlantic world’s foundational mode of political and social relation. This course will explore how this philosophical bracketing of the problem of auto-enslavement enabled Atlantic modernity to bracket slavery itself as an exceptional, pathological condition; we will then explore how the philosophical coding of humans as free by anthropological default affected the social, legal, and political life of the actually enslaved. The first part of this course will track the impossibilization of auto-enslavement in early modern and Enlightenment philosophical texts on international law, political theory, Biblical hermeneutics, and abolitionism.

Ideally, it will also refine you as a reader and a critic. We will approach every work of fiction we read, whether published or workshopped, from the writer’s perspective: in terms of form, character, and language, and how the writer succeeds, fails, or innovates in these areas. And since fiction, like any art, is essentially an expression of who we are and how we see the world, we will also begin developing our individual voices as writers. For the course, you will complete one full-length story, which you will present for class critique, and then write a significant revision of that story, which you will either present for a second workshop or turn into the instructor at the end of the quarter.

In this advanced workshop class, we’ll discuss the genre of young adult literature through evaluation of your own writing: what are its defining characteristics, and what’s the difference between writing for a young adult audience versus writing books and stories about teenagers but designed for adult readers? Students should be working on book-length projects involving teenaged protagonists, no matter the intended audience; please come to the first session with either work to submit or a sense of when you’d be able to sign up for a slot.

CRWR12020|Undergraduate|Open|Thu : 03:00 PM-05:50 PM|Fiction has many strategies for defamiliarizing the familiar, for destabilizing the ways we habitually think and feel about ourselves and our realities. Horror stories, considered broadly, go about this estranging work in more concerted ways, luring their characters into zones of emotional and perceptual extremity, violence, and metaphysical dislocation. In this course, we will pinpoint techniques used by (mostly) contemporary writers to deliver shades of fear in narratives rich enough to reward multiple readings. We’ll examine ways writers have engaged the tropes familiar to horror—e.g., doppelgangers, paranoia, the uncanny, the proximity of evil—in stories with complex characters, immersive sensory worlds, realistic social milieux, and potent ideas. Special attention will be paid to the uses of voice, atmosphere, and narrative architecture. Readings may include Henry James, Paul Bowles, Angela Carter, Ian McEwan, Joyce Carol Oates, Alice Munro, William Gay, David Foster Wallace, Reynolds Price, Mary Gaitskill, Kevin Brockmeier, and Karen Russell.

CRWR12122|Graduate|Open|Thu : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|Beginning writers are often told to “imitate” the work of “great authors” in order to discover their own voices. One way to enliven this artistic apprenticeship is to copy masterpieces from literary history with great care, but with a comic touch, too. Imitation with a difference—think Pride and Prejudice and Zombies—is the soul of parody, and in this course we’ll make mockeries of poetry, fiction, and essayistic nonfiction from the history of Western literature in order to learn how art works. Parodying Gertrude Stein’s parallax portraiture can illuminate the inner workings of literary mimesis itself. Satirizing Clarice Lispector’s proliferating points of view can teach us about the limits of perspective in narrative art. Satirizing Junishiro Tanizaki’s essayistic praise of shadows, we can study the role of polemic in literary nonfiction.

And more intriguingly, what can we learn from the successful ones, the films that are just as good if not better than the original written work—or so vastly different that they become their own entity? In this class, we will be reading works of short fiction and also “reading” their film adaptations, focusing on this relationship between storytelling on the page and storytelling on the screen and what is both lost and gained in that transition. If filmmaking requires a different language than fiction writing, a different approach to things like character, plot, atmosphere, even thematic development, what can we learn from that approach that we can apply to our own fiction, even if we have no interest in making films? We’ll investigate this question in the work of writers like James Joyce, Andre Dubus, and Stephen King, and filmmakers like Hitchcock, Huston, and Wilder.|Vu Tran|Midway Studios 108|Reading as a Writer: From Page to Film|1|[53612]|[]|SEM
CRWR13017|Undergraduate|Open|Thu : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|In this special topics course we will investigate and experiment with various approaches to imagery. Some fundamental questions will include: What are the variants of the image in poetry, and how do these variants create different stances in the poem? How does the image interface with formal attributes, such as sound, rhythm, and line breaks? Does a poetic image necessarily entail a representational mode of thinking, or are their variations that resist literary mimesis? Is abstraction really antithetical to the image, as is often assumed, or are there ways that, in poems, abstraction and imagery work in chorus? We will discuss radically different approaches to poetic image making (e.g. synesthetic, collaged, surrealist, eco-poetic, iterative, abstract, juxtapositional, absurdist, haiku, etc.) and the aesthetic effects and values that they entail.

This course will be an experiment in linking the extremely pragmatic and the extremely conceptual. Working from a few of the most successful speeches of Presidents Reagan and Obama, we will look to see how the pragmatic and the philosophical shape each other. We will spend roughly half our time on speech-writing nuts-and-bolts, and half our time on some of the philosophical commitments reflected in the language of these two political leaders. (In addition to the speeches themselves, the course reading will include philosophical texts that will provide a frame for examining these commitments.)

CRWR30205|Graduate|Closed|Wed : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|This beginning workshop is designed to encourage and refine your skills in writing fiction. Ideally, it will also refine you as a reader and a critic. We will approach every work of fiction we read, whether published or workshopped, from the writer’s perspective: in terms of form, character, and language, and how the writer succeeds, fails, or innovates in these areas. And since fiction, like any art, is essentially an expression of who we are and how we see the world, we will also begin developing our individual voices as writers. For the course, you will complete one full-length story, which you will present for class critique, and then write a significant revision of that story, which you will either present for a second workshop or turn into the instructor at the end of the quarter. The course will also include a series of writing exercises and readings in canonical and contemporary short fiction, all intended to stoke your creativity and illuminate the aesthetic traditions that inform your work.|William Boast|Midway Studios 102|Fundamentals of Fiction|1|[53598]|[]|SEM

We’ll take a close look at some of the building blocks that make up fiction writing: character, dialogue, plot, point of view, and setting. We’ll also read and discuss a variety of short stories, always with an eye to craft and to what you, as writers, can steal for your own work. That’s right, steal. Much of this class is devoted to learning how to steal the tools of great fiction writing, then to using those tools to realize your own vision. You’ll write extensively in and out of class, from weekly reading responses to writing exercises that build toward a polished piece of work. Finally, you will write a complete draft and one extensive revision of a short story or novel chapter.

It will expose students to ways that poets have both employed and resisted patterns in meter, line, and rhyme, and it will ask students to experiment with constraints as a way of playing with formal limitations in their own poems. Students will also explore innovations in diction, syntax, and voice, and apply what they learn from these investigations in workshop discussions.

CRWR32018|Graduate|Open|Wed : 03:00 PM-05:50 PM|The books and stories we read as teenagers are often some of the most influential in developing our tastes as adult readers and writers of fiction. In this advanced workshop class, we’ll discuss the genre of young adult literature through evaluation of your own writing: what are its defining characteristics, and what’s the difference between writing for a young adult audience versus writing books and stories about teenagers but designed for adult readers? Students should be working on book-length projects involving teenaged protagonists, no matter the intended audience; please come to the first session with either work to submit or a sense of when you’d be able to sign up for a slot. We’ll spend most of our time evaluating student work, learning how to become both generous and rigorous critics, and we’ll also talk about the books that influenced us the most as young adult readers and the books we’re reading today, from contemporary writers like John Green and Rainbow Rowell to classic authors like S.E. Hinton and Madeleine L’Engle. Students will read at least one or two novels during the quarter as well. Instructor consent required. Submit writing sample via www.creativewriting.uchicago.edu.

CRWR32020|Graduate|Open|Thu : 03:00 PM-05:50 PM|Fiction has many strategies for defamiliarizing the familiar, for destabilizing the ways we habitually think and feel about ourselves and our realities. Horror stories, considered broadly, go about this estranging work in more concerted ways, luring their characters into zones of emotional and perceptual extremity, violence, and metaphysical dislocation. In this course, we will pinpoint techniques used by (mostly) contemporary writers to deliver shades of fear in narratives rich enough to reward multiple readings. We’ll examine ways writers have engaged the tropes familiar to horror—e.g., doppelgangers, paranoia, the uncanny, the proximity of evil—in stories with complex characters, immersive sensory worlds, realistic social milieux, and potent ideas. Special attention will be paid to the uses of voice, atmosphere, and narrative architecture. Readings may include Henry James, Paul Bowles, Angela Carter, Ian McEwan, Joyce Carol Oates, Alice Munro, William Gay, David Foster Wallace, Reynolds Price, Mary Gaitskill, Kevin Brockmeier, and Karen Russell.

CRWR33017|Graduate|Open|Thu : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|In this special topics course we will investigate and experiment with various approaches to imagery. Some fundamental questions will include: What are the variants of the image in poetry, and how do these variants create different stances in the poem? How does the image interface with formal attributes, such as sound, rhythm, and line breaks? Does a poetic image necessarily entail a representational mode of thinking, or are their variations that resist literary mimesis? Is abstraction really antithetical to the image, as is often assumed, or are there ways that, in poems, abstraction and imagery work in chorus? We will discuss radically different approaches to poetic image making (e.g. synesthetic, collaged, surrealist, eco-poetic, iterative, abstract, juxtapositional, absurdist, haiku, etc.) and the aesthetic effects and values that they entail. We will also compare poetry’s sensory images to select practices in music, painting, photography, and film. Workshop discussions will focus on sensory elements of students’ poems and the poem as an organ of perception and feelings. Readings may include work by Bernard Badiou, Charles Baudelaire, André Breton, Mark Doty, Ezra Pound, William Carlos Williams, H.D., Elizabeth Bishop, Jared Stanley, Mei Mei Berssenbrugge, Francis Ponge, and others.

Our primary texts come from popular culture, film, visual art, and literature, which have provided lightning rods for controversy and protest in this charged climate. This course investigates the fraught relationship between marginal expressions of gender and sexuality on the one hand, and society’s notions of security and safety on the other. Whose safety matters? How do women and other minorities use artistic production, within and alongside the realm of popular culture, to advocate for their own conceptions of safety and what it might mean? From the erotic performance of feminine agency found in soft-core pornographic pink films, to the slippage between fantasy and reality found in the staged violence of women’s pro-wrestling, to the eco-feminism of activist Ishimure Michiko, and beyond, this course will explore the state of gender, femininity, and sexual politics in Japan, from the 1960s on into the present day.|Marianne Tarcov|TBA|Gender, Sexuality, Security Culture, and Protest in Post 3-11 Japan|1|[53654]|[{'instructor': 'Staff', 'sectionname': 'Section 1S01 [53655] - SCR Open', 'daytime': 'Wed : 07:00 PM-10:00 PM'}]|LEC
EALC22024|Undergraduate|Open|Tue Thu : 12:00 PM-01:20 PM|This course explores the shifting forms of Japanese mystery fiction and the functions the mystery genre has served both within modern Japanese literature and in Japanese mass culture as a whole. On the one hand, mystery writing in Japanese has proven to be a resilient and popular brand of “low” culture, often excluded from the realm of “pure” literature due to its focus on violence, lawlessness, and perversity. On the other, the treatment of these recurring themes according to established “rules” of the mystery genre has helped promote the creation of a reading public that shares a set of taboos and mores. Meanwhile, the problems tackled incisively by Japanese mystery works are often reflections of the larger societal problems posed by their time—including Westernization, imperial expansion, defeat in the Second World War, the arrival of economic prosperity, the collapse of the bubble economy, political corruption, and a perception of decline in the cohesiveness of community. Through examining mysteries, we will hope to arrive at a better understanding of how Japanese literature and society speak to and alter one another. Course materials include short stories, novels, and film from the 1920s to the present day by such writers and directors as Edogawa Rampo, Matsumoto Seicho, Miyabe Miyuki, Tanizaki Jun’ichiro, Kirino Natsuo, Kurosawa Akira, and Ichikawa Kon.

With a view to probing an inter- and intra-relationship between censorship practices among a variety of imperial/colonial regions, this course studies the institutions related to censorship, the human agents involved in censorship—both external and internal—and texts and translations that were produced in and outside of Korea, and were subject to censorship.

EALC43364|Graduate|Open|Tue : 09:45 AM-11:45 AM|The purpose of this course is to enhance the students’ understanding of the application of law and legal theory through study of the growing body of legal texts from pre-imperial and early imperial China. In addition to situating the Chinese legal materials in their varying legal, social, political, cultural and historical contexts, and thereby highlighting some of their unique elements, the course also familiarizes students with a wide range of theoretical materials (eg., anthropological, legal philosophical, economic, etc.) which may be useful in bringing to light any universalities of legal systems and behavior. However, discussion of any given text will be directed in large part by the nature and contents of the material itself. The Chinese materials, all readings of which will be in translation, range from commemorative inscriptions cast in bronze sacral vessels and descriptions of legal practices in received texts, to actual statutes and case records, philosophical texts and legal debates. The medium, discovery/transmission, and authorship of each document will be given due consideration for the effect they may have on our understanding of the contemporary legal context from which the text derives. The course culminates with student presentations on the material of their choice. Preparation for presentations will be conducted in consult with the instructor. Students are encouraged to draw from their study of other legal systems and/or systems of legal thought (both modern and pre-modern) in their discussion of the ancient Chinese material. It is hoped that the course will help students question their own assumptions about legal behavior, and the nature and role of law and legal systems in early China, specifically, and within the human world, generally.

We will discuss what it means to think like an economist, how you can use economic thinking to make the world a better place (or to take advantage of your friends and enemies, if you prefer), and also how sometimes thinking like an economist can get you into trouble.|Steven Levitt, John List|Kent Chem Lab 107|Economics for Everyone|1|[44158]|[{'instructor': 'Staff', 'sectionname': 'Section 1D01 [44159] - DIS Open', 'daytime': 'Mon : 06:00 PM-06:50 PM'}]|LEC

ECON20000|Undergraduate|Open|Mon Wed : 10:30 AM-11:50 AM|This course develops the economic theory of consumer choice. This theory characterizes optimal choices for consumers given their incomes and preferences, as well as the relative prices of different goods. This course develops tools for analyzing how these optimal choices change when relative prices and consumer incomes change. Finally, this course presents several measures of consumer welfare. Students learn how to evaluate the impact of taxes and subsidies using these measures. Completion of ECON 19800 is strongly recommended of students without a prior microeconomics course. Prerequisite(s): MATH 13300 (with prior completion of or at least concurrent with MATH 19520), MATH 15300, or 16300.

ENGL17818|Undergraduate|Open|Mon Wed : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM|In American popular culture, the eighteenth century is remembered today (to the extent that it is remembered at all) as a heady time of revolutions and revolutionaries, when towering figures of the Enlightenment established modern democracy. This, in many ways, reflects the narrative eighteenth-century writers were developing about their own age. For British Whigs, the “Glorious Revolution” of 1688 had been a watershed moment at which the arbitrary rule of kings had been replaced for all time by constitutionalism; the social contract and the civil polity had triumphed over divine-right ideology, ushering in a new, beneficent era of progress. And, in the 1790s, the French Revolution fired the political imaginations of British radicals who saw the potential for a world made anew – a world of universal suffrage and gender equality, where slavery was abolished. Clearly, attaining these goals was a long way off. The debates over the structures, meanings, and nature of consent had tendrils in multiple areas of society – the law, of course, but also in understandings of sexuality, constructions of gender, economics, and colonization. Questions of rights, agency, and authority (what those categories meant, who could possess them, and who guaranteed them) were by no means settled, and, indeed, throughout the century, calls to curtail the categories of people who should have access to the sphere of political influence were often as boisterous as those to expand such access. This course will explore how a range of authors in eighteenth-century Britain figured questions of consent, rights, and authority and how the ideological debates these authors mediated continue to inform contemporary politics, cultures, and identities. We will read works by literary figures such as Daniel Defoe, Samuel Richardson, Mary Hays, Olaudah Equiano, and Mary Shelley. We will consider the writings of some of the major political philosophers of the day, as well, including John Locke, Thomas Hobbes, Mary Astell, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Thomas Paine, and Mary Wollstonecraft. We will additionally discuss readings in modern criticism and theory to help us better situate our primary texts in the discourses of modernity and better understand their lasting resonances.|Tristan Schweiger|TBA|Consent and Coercion: Rights, Agency, and Authority in the Eighteenth Century and Beyond|1|[42900]|[]|SEM

We then consider imperial debates over taxation in the 1760s and 1770s, returning Benjamin Franklin’s Autobiography to its original context. Reading Paine’s Common Sense and the letters of Abigail Adams and John Adams we look at the multiple meanings of independence. We study Jefferson’s drafting process, read the Declaration over the shoulders of people on both sides of the Atlantic, and consider clues to contemporary meanings beyond the intentions of Congress. Finally, we briefly engage the post-revolutionary history of the place and meaning of the Declaration in American life. (F)|Eric Slauter|TBA|The Declaration of Independence|1|[43737]|[]|SEM

ENGL21006|Undergraduate|Open|Mon Wed : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM|Course centers on Joseph Conrad’s The Secret Agent: A Simple Tale. Contemporary critics often consider this novel the archetypal fictional work about terrorism, as it is based on the bomb attack that occurred in Greenwich in 1888. The Secret Agent demonstrates, however, much more than its prophetic significance rediscovered after 9/11. Therefore, the course seeks how the novel’s relevance stems in equal measure from Conrad’s interest in a wider political process and his distrust of state power; in particular, the course explores how these forces determine the individual caught in a confining situation. We read The Secret Agent as a political novel, that struggle for solutions defies chaos as well as an imposition of a single ideology or one authorial point of view. Its ambiguities and political antinomies allow for interdisciplinary readings that also present an opportunity to critically overview the established approaches to main Conradian themes. In analyzing the formation of the narrative’s ideology we discuss Conrad’s historical pessimism that demonstrates with sustained irony how capitalism breeds social injustice that, in turn, breeds anarchism. The class also focuses on how the novel exposes duplicity in staging surveillance, terrorism, as well as adjacent forms of violence or sacrifice.

This class will read science fiction, feminist theory and current critical work that concerns itself with bios, biology and biopolitics in order to ask questions about the divide between nature and culture, what’s entailed in imagining the future, what gender and genre have to do with each other, and just what science fiction is and does anyway.

ENGL24212|Undergraduate|Open|Tue Thu : 04:30 PM-05:50 PM|In 1971, the writer Tomás Rivera described the “Chicano renaissance” as a process of self-invention that involved the “exteriorization of our will”—an effort that motivated a “life in search of form.” This course will examine some of the most ambitious works of literature that are the result of this search. Our guiding inquiries will be simultaneously interpretive, theoretical, and historical: What does it mean to think of form as an “exteriorization” of one’s “will”? Whose will do these forms represent (who is the “us” in Rivera’s “our will”)? What representational strategies enable this exteriorization and dramatize its limitations? Why was the novel so often singled out, and why did some feminist writers prefer instead a collection of letters, poems, journal entries, and personal essays? These questions will inform our study of the consolidation of a self-conscious Chicago literature and its attendant literary history. Students of the course will therefore not only become familiar with exciting works of textual art, they will also study the institutional context that enables the consolidation of “a literature,” and a “literary history.” Authors will include José Antonio Villarreal, Tomás Rivera, Rudolfo Anaya, Cherríe Moraga, Ana Castillo, and Gloria Anzaldúa.

Worrying ourselves into the realm of the pathological, we now have a requisite measure of anxiety for every prescribed stage of life. But why are we so anxious? Considering its prevalence in everyday life, the concept and theories of anxiety have been employed surprisingly seldom as a way into film, fiction, and art. In this course we examine the modern origin of contemporary discourses specific to anxiety and their unique manifestation in cultural artifacts. To understand the complex of anxiety in the so-called Western world, we rely on the theories of Søren Kierkegaard, Martin Heidegger, Sigmund Freud, Jacques Lacan, and Alenka Zupančič; fiction by Stoker, Schnitzler, Kafka, and Sebald; and film by Haneke, Kubrick, Ophuls, and Hitchcock.

But while a fortune might alleviate financial hardship, it creates problems of its own. Like our present moment, the turn of the 20th century saw rapid changes in technology and finance generate unprecedented wealth inequality. In this period of rapid urbanization and industrialization, writers explored how rapidly changing financial circumstances might change a person’s life. This course surveys major American novels from the late 19th and early 20th centuries to ask questions like: How does money articulate with social class in the context of American political ideology? How do writers represent the moral status and responsibilities of the wealthy as different from those of the poor? What can literary texts tell us about the world in which they were produced and consumed? Readings will include texts by William Dean Howells, Frank Norris, Theodore Dreiser, F.

ENGL28619|Undergraduate|Open|Mon Wed : 03:00 PM-04:20 PM|In this course, we examine the perspectives, debates, and attitudes that characterize the contemporary field of postcolonial theory, with attention to how its interdisciplinary formation contributes to reading literary works. We begin by surveying the development and trajectory of the field, particularly as it develops around debates on revolution and compromise, cosmopolitanism, the psychology of colonialism, and anti-colonial historiography. Alongside this, we consider the recent disciplinary revival of the categories of “global Anglophone” and “world literature” through readings on “literary worlds” to to evaluate these categories, and their contributions to ongoing debates about translation/translatability, vernaculars, rewriting, and mimicry. What are the claims made on behalf of literary texts in orienting us to other lives and possibilities, and in registering the experience of geographic and cultural displacement? To better answer this, we read recent scholarship that engages the field in conversations around intimacy, belonging, and human rights, to think about the impulses that animate the field, and its possible futures. Readings will likely include works by Debjani Ganguly, Kamau Brathwaite, Jean Rhys, Amitava Kumar, Sara Ahmed and Amitav Ghosh.|Darrel Chia|TBA|Postcolonial Openings|1|[54369]|[]|SEM

ENGL31006|Graduate|Open|Mon Wed : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM|Course centers on Joseph Conrad’s The Secret Agent: A Simple Tale. Contemporary critics often consider this novel the archetypal fictional work about terrorism, as it is based on the bomb attack that occurred in Greenwich in 1888. The Secret Agent demonstrates, however, much more than its prophetic significance rediscovered after 9/11. Therefore, the course seeks how the novel’s relevance stems in equal measure from Conrad’s interest in a wider political process and his distrust of state power; in particular, the course explores how these forces determine the individual caught in a confining situation. We read The Secret Agent as a political novel, that struggle for solutions defies chaos as well as an imposition of a single ideology or one authorial point of view. Its ambiguities and political antinomies allow for interdisciplinary readings that also present an opportunity to critically overview the established approaches to main Conradian themes. In analyzing the formation of the narrative’s ideology we discuss Conrad’s historical pessimism that demonstrates with sustained irony how capitalism breeds social injustice that, in turn, breeds anarchism. The class also focuses on how the novel exposes duplicity in staging surveillance, terrorism, as well as adjacent forms of violence or sacrifice. Critical texts include several older but still influential readings (Jameson, Eagleton) and the most recent.|Bozena Shallcross|TBA|Joseph Conrad's The Secret Agent: (In)action, Surveillance, Terrorism|1|[42361]|[]|LEC

Data suggests a rapidly growing divergence between those earners at the bottom and those at the top. This course seeks to place that current concern in conversation with a range of moments in nineteenth and twentieth century history when literature and economics converged on questions of economic inequality. In keeping with recent political economic scholarship by Thomas Piketty, we will be adopting a long historic view and a somewhat wide geographic scale as we explore how economic inequality is represented, measured, assessed, and addressed. Readings will include some of the following literature: Hard Times, Le Pere Goriot, The Jungle, The Time Machine, Native Son, Landscape for a Good Woman, White Tiger; and some of the following economic and political texts: Principles of Political Economy, The Acquisitive Society, The Theory of the Leisure Class, Capital (Marx and Piketty), The Price of Inequality, and Inequality Re-examined.

ENGL37818|Graduate|Open|Mon Wed : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM|In American popular culture, the eighteenth century is remembered today (to the extent that it is remembered at all) as a heady time of revolutions and revolutionaries, when towering figures of the Enlightenment established modern democracy. This, in many ways, reflects the narrative eighteenth-century writers were developing about their own age. For British Whigs, the “Glorious Revolution” of 1688 had been a watershed moment at which the arbitrary rule of kings had been replaced for all time by constitutionalism; the social contract and the civil polity had triumphed over divine-right ideology, ushering in a new, beneficent era of progress. And, in the 1790s, the French Revolution fired the political imaginations of British radicals who saw the potential for a world made anew – a world of universal suffrage and gender equality, where slavery was abolished. Clearly, attaining these goals was a long way off. The debates over the structures, meanings, and nature of consent had tendrils in multiple areas of society – the law, of course, but also in understandings of sexuality, constructions of gender, economics, and colonization. Questions of rights, agency, and authority (what those categories meant, who could possess them, and who guaranteed them) were by no means settled, and, indeed, throughout the century, calls to curtail the categories of people who should have access to the sphere of political influence were often as boisterous as those to expand such access. This course will explore how a range of authors in eighteenth-century Britain figured questions of consent, rights, and authority and how the ideological debates these authors mediated continue to inform contemporary politics, cultures, and identities. We will read works by literary figures such as Daniel Defoe, Samuel Richardson, Mary Hays, Olaudah Equiano, and Mary Shelley. We will consider the writings of some of the major political philosophers of the day, as well, including John Locke, Thomas Hobbes, Mary Astell, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Thomas Paine, and Mary Wollstonecraft. We will additionally discuss readings in modern criticism and theory to help us better situate our primary texts in the discourses of modernity and better understand their lasting resonances.|Tristan Schweiger|TBA|Consent and Coercion: Rights, Agency, and Authority in the Eighteenth Century and Beyond|1|[42901]|[]|SEM

Taking works by Charlotte and Emily Brontë, Charles Dickens, Henry Mayhew, Thomas Hardy, and Henry James as our principle points of departure, our course will pursue the “Victorian unconscious” through three lines of questioning: First, we will ask how Victorian literature anticipated the development of psychoanalytic concepts, such as the unconscious, repression, infantile sexuality and the symptom. At the same time, we will question whether Freud’s reflections on the psychopathologies of modern culture can in fact help to explain specific structural and social transformations in the 19th century public sphere, like the construction of modern sewer systems, the legal regulation of sexual acts, or the development of obscenity law. Finally, we will interrogate how the unconscious operates as a site of theoretical interest within Marxist and postcolonial critiques of modern imperialism. Our readings of 19th century novels will be complemented by extensive readings in psychoanalytic theory (Freud, Klein, Lacan, Winnicott) and pre-pscyhoanalytic psychiatry (e.g. Esquirol, Tuke, Krafft-Ebing, Charcot, Cotard), as well as relevant works by theorists elaborating and questioning psychoanalytic insights, including George Batailles, Michel Foucault, Jacques Rancière, Frederic Jameson, Edward Said, Kaja Silverman, Lauren Berlant, Eve Kosofsky Sed|Zachary Samalin|Rosenwald Hall 405|The Victorian Unconscious|1|[41087]|[]|SEM

ENGL55300|Graduate|Open|Thu : 03:00 PM-05:50 PM|This course will trace the philosophical, juridical, and literary itinerary of modernity’s impossible subject: the person who enslaves himself. From Grotius to Vitoria through Hobbes and Locke up to Mill and beyond, the one thing that modernity’s self-possessive subject cannot will to alienate, sell, or give away is himself. From this perspective, slavery can only be a relation of domination or as a vanishing moment before the enslaved contracts into servitude. In the process of installing this perspective, philosophical modernity foreclosed myriad philosophical and legal traditions of self-enslavement at the precise moment that slavery itself was generalized as the Atlantic world’s foundational mode of political and social relation. This course will explore how this philosophical bracketing of the problem of auto-enslavement enabled Atlantic modernity to bracket slavery itself as an exceptional, pathological condition; we will then explore how the philosophical coding of humans as free by anthropological default affected the social, legal, and political life of the actually enslaved. The first part of this course will track the impossibilization of auto-enslavement in early modern and Enlightenment philosophical texts on international law, political theory, Biblical hermeneutics, and abolitionism. In the second part of this course, we will examine black and white improvisations with the figure of the self-enslaving subject, reading slave narratives, legal texts and cases.|Christopher Taylor|Walker Museum 403|I'm a Slave for You|1|[41089]|[]|SEM

While in an age of global migrations, multilingual speakers have come to outnumber the number of monolingual speakers, literary studies continue to privilege works aimed at a monolingual audience. This is particularly the case in the United States, where “English-only” attitudes have dominated discourse for over a century. This course instead explores literary works that take up residence in the space between two or more languages, whether national or regional—as well as those that attempt to dodge semantic systems altogether. From modernist collage and transense to contemporary poetry of exile, migration, and diaspora, the works we will study, lodged between tongues, lend nuance and fascination to debates surrounding “global literature” and untranslatability. We will examine the formal and social prompts and repercussions of experiments in polylingualism, barbarism, dialect, creole, and thwarted translation, and will delve into examples of the potential for mixed/new media poetics to accommodate multiple linguistic systems. While it is not at all necessary for students to be fluent in more than one language to take this course, some experience learning or attempting to learn languages beyond English is essential.

FNDL21006|Undergraduate|Open|Mon Wed : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM|Course centers on Joseph Conrad’s The Secret Agent: A Simple Tale. Contemporary critics often consider this novel the archetypal fictional work about terrorism, as it is based on the bomb attack that occurred in Greenwich in 1888. The Secret Agent demonstrates, however, much more than its prophetic significance rediscovered after 9/11. Therefore, the course seeks how the novel’s relevance stems in equal measure from Conrad’s interest in a wider political process and his distrust of state power; in particular, the course explores how these forces determine the individual caught in a confining situation. We read The Secret Agent as a political novel, that struggle for solutions defies chaos as well as an imposition of a single ideology or one authorial point of view. Its ambiguities and political antinomies allow for interdisciplinary readings that also present an opportunity to critically overview the established approaches to main Conradian themes. In analyzing the formation of the narrative’s ideology we discuss Conrad’s historical pessimism that demonstrates with sustained irony how capitalism breeds social injustice that, in turn, breeds anarchism. The class also focuses on how the novel exposes duplicity in staging surveillance, terrorism, as well as adjacent forms of violence or sacrifice. Critical texts include several older but still influential readings (Jameson, Eagleton) and the most recent.|Bozena Shallcross|TBA|Joseph Conrad's The Secret Agent: (In)action, Surveillance, Terrorism|1|[42362]|[]|LEC

FNDL21714|Undergraduate|Open|Mon : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|One of the most important and influential works of the middle ages—and a lot funnier than the Divine Comedy. Boccaccio’s Decameron, written in the midst of the social disruption caused by the Black Death (1348), may have held readers attention for centuries because of its bawdiness, but it is also a profound exploration into the basis of faith and the meaning of death, the status of language, the construction of social hierarchy and social order, and the nature of crisis and historical change. Framed by a story telling contest between seven young ladies and three young men who have left the city to avoid the plague, the one hundred stories of the Decameron form a structural masterpiece that anticipates Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales, the Renaissance epics, and the modern short story. We will especially focus on how the work explores the intersection of legal and literary representation but students will be encouraged to further explore in individual projects the many topics raised by the text, including (and in addition to the themes mentioned above) magic, the visual arts, mercantile culture, travel and discovery, and new religious practices.|Justin Steinberg|TBA|Boccaccio's Decameron|1|[54801]|[]|SEM

As we read through these works, we will also take up the wider historical and political context—e.g., the fifth-century rise of Athenian democracy and imperialism—and the relationship between our texts and other genres, including philosophy, drama, and rhetoric. The aim of the course is not only to give students a close familiarity with our two authors and some of the scholarship surrounding them, but also, more broadly, to think through the relationship between political theory and history. How might political theory guide the writing of history, and how can history contribute to theorizing politics?

This erudite Polish author is a prime 20th century modernist whose novels, entangled in an ongoing battle with fundamental questions and, indeed, with existence itself, explode with uncanny laughter. In contrast to many of his contemporary writers who established their reputation by applying existing philosophical models, Gombrowicz employed ironically his philosophical erudition, while engaging in his philosophical récit the literary and cultural tropes which derived from his Polish cultural heritage. Over the next ten weeks, we will investigate how he twisted these references and tropes to inform a distinctly Gombrowiczian version of performative philosophy. We will read Gombrowicz’s novels, lectures on philosophy and some of his autobiographical writings to seek answers to our overarching question: what makes this author a philosopher?|Bozena Shallcross|Foster Hall 408|Gombrowicz: The Writer as Philosopher|1|[42356]|[]|LEC

Originally published in 1943, it is one of Strauss’s most intransigent essays.

GEOG40217|Graduate|Open|Mon Wed : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM|This course covers statistical and econometric methods specifically geared to the problems of spatial dependence and spatial heterogeneity in cross-sectional data. The main objective of the course is to gain insight into the scope of spatial regression methods, to be able to apply them in an empirical setting, and to properly interpret the results of spatial regression analysis. While the focus is on spatial aspects, the types of methods covered have general validity in statistical practice. The course covers the specification of spatial regression models in order to incorporate spatial dependence and spatial heterogeneity, as well as different estimation methods and specification tests to detect the presence of spatial autocorrelation and spatial heterogeneity. Special attention is paid to the application to spatial models of generic statistical paradigms, such as Maximum Likelihood, Generalized Methods of Moments and the Bayesian perspective. An important aspect of the course is the application of open source software tools such as R, GeoDa and PySal to solve empirical problems.|Luc Anselin|TBA|Spatial Regression Analysis|1|[42094]|[]|LEC

This course explores the emergence of the 'Middle East' as an object of inquiry; a place with a people and a culture set in opposition to the 'West'. It asks how these categories are constituted, by whom, and with what consequence. How do they define the contours of political community, the possibilities for empathy and understanding or the limits of rights and moral obligation? The historical and contemporary texts assigned draw attention to the layered and shifting meanings of these categories, and in turn to the geopolitical and epistomological worlds that give rise to them. By putting these texts into conversation with each other the course engages a number of key issues that have occupied social theorists: the relationship between power and knowledge, the politics of representation, and the nature of social theory more generally.|Yaqub Hilal|TBA|Rethinking the Middle East|1|[43387]|[]|SEM

Our primary texts come from popular culture, film, visual art, and literature, which have provided lightning rods for controversy and protest in this charged climate.

Taking works by Charlotte and Emily Brontë, Charles Dickens, Henry Mayhew, Thomas Hardy, and Henry James as our principle points of departure, our course will pursue the “Victorian unconscious” through three lines of questioning: First, we will ask how Victorian literature anticipated the development of psychoanalytic concepts, such as the unconscious, repression, infantile sexuality and the symptom. At the same time, we will question whether Freud’s reflections on the psychopathologies of modern culture can in fact help to explain specific structural and social transformations in the 19th century public sphere, like the construction of modern sewer systems, the legal regulation of sexual acts, or the development of obscenity law. Finally, we will interrogate how the unconscious operates as a site of theoretical interest within Marxist and postcolonial critiques of modern imperialism. Our readings of 19th century novels will be complemented by extensive readings in psychoanalytic theory (Freud, Klein, Lacan, Winnicott) and pre-pscyhoanalytic psychiatry (e.g. Esquirol, Tuke, Krafft-Ebing, Charcot, Cotard), as well as relevant works by theorists elaborating and questioning psychoanalytic insights, including George Batailles, Michel Foucault, Jacques Rancière, Frederic Jameson, Edward Said, Kaja Silverman, Lauren Berlant, Eve Kosofsky Sed|Zachary Samalin|Rosenwald Hall 405|The Victorian Unconscious|1|[55344]|[]|SEM

This history encompasses subjects that have retained their relevance in contemporary life, including racial and ethnic stereotypes, armchair travel, virtual versus lived reality, authenticity and artifice, mass entertainment, city life, celebrity, and gender. Readings will include a series of theoretical works in combination with articles and monographs, to provide a broader underpinning for the problems of perception and historical analysis at play in this realm of scholarly thought and practice."|Amy Lippert|TBA|Visual Culture in American Life, 1800-1915|1|[54217]|[]|SEM

GRMN23715|Undergraduate|Open|Tue Thu : 03:30 PM-04:50 PM|Berlin at the turn of the 19th century was the epicenter of Germany’s rapid urbanization and industrialization, and as such it became a privileged site for observing and experiencing modernity. One of the most prominent features of life in the modern metropolis, as noted by contemporaries, was its fragmentary character, both in social terms—the atomization of society as a whole—and in mental terms—the psychic instability of the atomized individual. This course explores a variety of critical and artistic responses to fragmentation: critical efforts to render the fragmented urban landscape legible, and literary and other artistic efforts to explore the potentialities of fragmentation through innovative forms and techniques. The main part of the course will focus on the Weimar period: literature, film and criticism of the Golden Twenties. Afterwards we will turn to short fiction, poetry, and film of post-unification Berlin. Authors include Carl Sternheim, Walter Benjamin, Siegfried Kracauer, Joseph Roth, Alfred Döblin, Georg Heym, Jacob von Hoddis, Alfred Lichtenstein, Gottfried Benn, Bertolt Brecht, Durs Grünbein, and Tanja Dückers.

Mann began the novel under the Weimar Republic and continued working on the novel in exile. The writer himself saw his novel as an act of resistance to his country’s anti-Semitic policies.

Worrying ourselves into the realm of the pathological, we now have a requisite measure of anxiety for every prescribed stage of life. But why are we so anxious? Considering its prevalence in everyday life, the concept and theories of anxiety have been employed surprisingly seldom as a way into film, fiction, and art. In this course we examine the modern origin of contemporary discourses specific to anxiety and their unique manifestation in cultural artifacts. To understand the complex of anxiety in the so-called Western world, we rely on the theories of Søren Kierkegaard, Martin Heidegger, Sigmund Freud, Jacques Lacan, and Alenka Zupančič; fiction by Stoker, Schnitzler, Kafka, and Sebald; and film by Haneke, Kubrick, Ophuls, and Hitchcock.

This course will focus on a number of medieval women writers, dealing mainly albeit not exclusively with vernacular texts. After a historical overview of the position of women in the early Middle Ages, the course will focus on Heloise and Hildegard of Bingen as transitional figures, and continue with four women writers writing in the vernacular, i.e., Mechtild of Magdeburg, Hadewijch, Marguerite Porete and Julian of Norwich. The course will link the spectrum of vernacular languages which they represent to the diversity of their individual positions and analyze that diversity in terms of ecclesiastical developments, gender division, authorial identity, and theological criticism.

HCHR51610|Graduate|Open|Mon : 06:00 PM-08:50 PM|Venice’s long-standing ties with the Byzantine Empire have left their visible trace in the city’s art and architecture and have had an equally strong impact on Venetian myth-making in the pre-modern period. Until today the appropriation of Byzantine style is especially evident in the church of Saint Mark the Evangelist, as well as in the decoration of less-well known medieval churches of the Venetian Lagoon. During the so-called Fourth Crusade, the Sack of Constantinople has led to large-scale pillaging of the Byzantine capital and the transfer to Venice of countless Byzantine artifacts, among them are liturgical items, reliquaries, icons, and architectural spoils. How were these artifacts employed in the Venetian Lagoon for religious and political ends after being disassociated from their original contexts? What transformations did they experience with regard to usage and appearance? What kinds of new ceremonies, both religious and secular, did they inspire? What was their impact on artistic creativity and religious life in their new environment? How were they perceived intellectually, and what kinds of narratives evolved around them in Venice over the centuries? These are some of the key questions to guide our research. On a broader scale, we will investigate various phenomena of cultural transfer and ‘hybridity’ from the Middle Ages to the Baroque era.|Karin Krause|Swift Hall 201|Between East and West: Venice in the Pre-Modern Period|1|[41405]|[]|SEM

Students will examine the theoretical and methodological groundings of cultural psychiatry, examining how scholars working in the phenomenological tradition have tried to describe the lived experiences of various forms of “psychopathology” or “madness.” By the end of the course, students will have learned how to describe and analyze the social dimension of a mental health experience, using a phenomenologically-grounded anthropological approach, and by adopting a technical vocabulary for understanding the lived experiences of mental illness (for instance, phenomena, life-world, being-in-the-world, intentionality, epoché, embodiment, madness, psychopathology, melancholia/depression, schizophrenia, etc). In addition, given the ongoing problematic of “how to represent mental illness,” students will also have the opportunity to think through the different ways of presenting their analysis, both in the form of weekly blog entries and during a final-week mock-workshop, where they will showcase their work in a creative medium appropriate to that analysis.|Francis McKay|Saieh Hall for Economics 247|Experiencing Madness: Empathic Methods in Cultural Psychiatry|1|[53675]|[]|SEM

HIPS25506|Undergraduate|Open|Tue : 12:00 PM-02:50 PM|One can distinguish four ways in which science and aesthetics are related during the period since the Renaissance. First, science has been the subject of artistic representation, in painting and photography, in poetry and novels (e.g., in Byron’s poetry, for example). Second, science has been used to explain aesthetic effects (e.g., Helmholtz’s work on the way painters achieve visual effects or musicians achieve tonal effects). Third, aesthetic means have been used to convey scientific conceptions (e.g., through illustrations in scientific volumes or through aesthetically affective and effective writing). Finally, philosophers have stepped back to consider the relationship between scientific knowing and aesthetic comprehension (e.g., Kant, Bas van Fraassen); much of the discussion of this latter will focus on the relation between images and what they represent.

Historians have often relegated Iberia and its New World domains from accounts of the developments of modern science. They have traditionally claimed that strict censorship and a commitment to orthodox Catholicism prevented Spain, once the most powerful empire of the world, from embarking on the path towards scientific modernity in the eighteenth century. Modern scholars, however, have challenged this narrative by embracing more inclusive concepts of ""science"" to explain the many ways in which early modern people related to nature. Some of these practices include the writing of natural histories, botanical research, and linguistic studies, all fields that Iberian scholars pioneered in their efforts to govern their vast domains.

HIST10102|Undergraduate|Open|Mon Wed : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM|The second segment of the African Civilizations sequence uses anthropological perspectives to investigate colonial and postcolonial encounters in West and East Africa. The course objective is to show that while colonialism was brutal and oppressive, it was by no means a unidirectional process of domination in which Europeans plundered the African continent and enforced a wholesale adoption of European culture. Rather, scholars today recognize that colonial encounters were complex culture, political, and economic fields of interaction. Africans actively adopted, reworked, and contested colonizers' policies and projects, and Europeans drew heavily from these encounters to form liberal conceptions of self, nation, and society. Over the course of the quarter, students will learn about forms of personhood, political economy, and everyday life in the twentieth century. Course themes will include social reproduction, kinship practices, medicine, domesticity, and development.

HIST24005|Undergraduate|Open|Mon Wed : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM|How and why do national identities provoke the deep emotional attachments that they do? In this course we try to understand these emotional attachments by examining the narrative of loss and redemption through which most nations in the Balkans retell their Ottoman past. We begin by considering the mythic temporality of the Romantic national narrative while focusing on specific national literary texts where the national past is retold through the formula of original wholeness, foreign invasion, Passion, and Salvation. We then proceed to unpack the structural role of the different elements of that narrative. With the help of Žižek’s theory of the subject as constituted by trauma, we think about the national fixation on the trauma of loss, and the role of trauma in the formation of national consciousness. Specific theme inquiries involve the figure of the Janissary as self and other, brotherhood and fratricide, and the writing of the national trauma on the individual physical body. Special attention is given to the general aesthetic of victimhood, the casting of the victimized national self as the object of the “other’s perverse desire.” With the help of Freud, Žižek, and Kant we consider the transformation of national victimhood into the sublimity of the national self. The main primary texts include Petar Njegoš’ Mountain Wreath (Serbia and Montenegro), Ismail Kadare’s The Castle (Albania), Anton Donchev’s Time of Parting (Bulgaria).|Angelina Ilieva|Foster Hall 408|The Burden of History: The Nation and Its Lost Paradise|1|[42376]|[]|LEC

Although much that we will read describes the twentieth century, we will also discover that innovations in gender roles are not unique to the past hundred years. Nor, despite long-standing stereotypes to the contrary, has it only been the privilege of the elites to disrupt the traditional male-female binary. Readings will address such themes as the ways in which gender defines patterns in family life, in politics and under the law; marriage and homosexuality; prostitution and trafficking; performance and cross dressing; the implementation of the one child policy; gender roles in minority communities; and China's handling of HIV/AIDS. We will consider the role of old Confucian hierarchies and scrutinize the links between industrialization, women's liberation, nationalism, and the communist movement. Through these diverse topics, this seminar aims to expand students' conception of the areas in which gender plays a relevant and influential role."|Johanna Ransmeier|TBA|Gender and Sexuality in Modern China|1|[42902]|[]|SEM

It explores the ""timefulness"" of cinematic images without assuming their automatic relation to the world or dismissing films for their invention, compression, and elision of historical facts. A close reading of a wide range of films produced in and about Japan in tandem with primary and secondary materials on theories of time, images, and national history will highlight the historicity and history of both film and Japan."|James Ketelaar|TBA|Japanese Hist:Thru Film/Texts|1|[42908]|[]|SEM

With a slight emphasis on the natural sciences--but broadening out our view when necessary--we will examine how German scientists chose to interact with six (or seven, depending on how you count) Germanys--the German Empire (1871-1918), the Weimar Republic (1919-1933), the Third Reich (1933-1945), occupied Germany (1945-1949), West and East Germany (1949-1990), and the reunified Germany of today (1990-present). How did these scientists build relationships with the various governments? What were their reactions to the various forms of government (i.e. democracy vs. fascist dictatorship vs. 'real existing socialism')? How did emerging concepts of ethics in science play into scientists' relations with the political sphere?

HIST25506|Undergraduate|Open|Tue : 12:00 PM-02:50 PM|One can distinguish four ways in which science and aesthetics are related during the period since the Renaissance. First, science has been the subject of artistic representation, in painting and photography, in poetry and novels (e.g., in Byron’s poetry, for example). Second, science has been used to explain aesthetic effects (e.g., Helmholtz’s work on the way painters achieve visual effects or musicians achieve tonal effects). Third, aesthetic means have been used to convey scientific conceptions (e.g., through illustrations in scientific volumes or through aesthetically affective and effective writing). Finally, philosophers have stepped back to consider the relationship between scientific knowing and aesthetic comprehension (e.g., Kant, Bas van Fraassen); much of the discussion of this latter will focus on the relation between images and what they represent. In this lecture-discussion course we will consider all of these aspects of the science-aesthetic connection.|Robert Richards|TBA|Science and Aesthetics in the 18th-21st Centuries|1|[42918]|[]|SEM

HIST26117|Undergraduate|Open|Tue Thu : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM|“Progress,” and its derived concept of “development” have puzzled Latin Americans throughout their modern history: they were an ambitious goal and a challenge for intellectual and political elites, a reality and an elusive dream for ordinary Latin Americans, and the cause of new challenges and problems wherever they actually or presumably took place. For historians, progress and development used to represent the very sense of universal history, a narrative that sneaked into visions of “Western modernity” and “globalization.” But later on, they became a myth to debunk rather than an object of reflection. What has “progress” meant particularly for Latin Americans? What is, for instance, the meaning of “progress” in the Brazilian flag? How did those notions shape the one of “development” since WWII? In political terms, what ideas of “progress” and “development” animated oligarchic, liberal, populist, military, revolutionary, and democratic projects across the region? Because both concepts involve planning and envisioning the outcome of present actions, the history of progress and development is also, in a certain way, a history of the future. The goal of this seminar is to help students situate a problem of their choice and trace its history in terms of the political debates that pursued the goal of progress and development in that specific realm.|Pablo Palomino|Psychology K114|Progress and Development in Latin America|1|[41613]|[]|LEC

Historians have often relegated Iberia and its New World domains from accounts of the developments of modern science. They have traditionally claimed that strict censorship and a commitment to orthodox Catholicism prevented Spain, once the most powerful empire of the world, from embarking on the path towards scientific modernity in the eighteenth century. Modern scholars, however, have challenged this narrative by embracing more inclusive concepts of ""science"" to explain the many ways in which early modern people related to nature. Some of these practices include the writing of natural histories, botanical research, and linguistic studies, all fields that Iberian scholars pioneered in their efforts to govern their vast domains. This course will introduce students to a diversity of scientific practices that flourished in the Hispanic world between 1400 and 1800."|Valeria Lopez Fadul|TBA|Nature, Science, and Empire in the Early Modern Iberian World, 1400-1800|1|[42927]|[]|SEM

This course will examine this three-hundred-year history by investigating the following essential questions: (1) How did a collection of diverse kingdoms manage to create a global empire? (2) What specific factors can explain the Spanish decline of the seventeenth century? (3) Was the Spanish Empire doomed to fail from the very beginning? (4) Why did many colonial subjects remain loyal to Spain after the Conquest and especially after a century of decline? (5) Why did the empire collapse only after 1808? In our exploration of these questions, we will pay particular attention to Spain's ambitious and pioneering, if also destructive, involvement with conquest, colonial exploitation, chattel slavery, racial domination, and a mission to ""civilize"" the world. We will then proceed to investigate the Spanish decline of the seventeenth century and the influence of the emerging empires of Britain, France, and the Dutch Republic. The course concludes by examining Spain's effort to reform its empire during the eighteenth century, interrogating whether this effort alienated Spanish colonial subjects and ultimately contributed to the dissolution of the empire."|Fidel Tavarez|TBA|The Rise and Fall of the Spanish Empire|1|[42930]|[]|SEM

Many of the chief theoretical concerns of the Intelligentsia (the role of the public intellectual in society, the expression of dissidence and the ethics of exile) have preoccupied thinkers since Socrates. What distinguishes the Intelligentsia from other models of public intellectualism? How have various Slavic public intellectuals maintained, or broken with, this tradition? In order to establish a theoretical vocabulary, the course will begin with an introduction to several classical and contemporary theories of the role of the intellectual in society. We will then ground our inquiry in the historical invention of the Russian Intelligentsia during the mid-19th Century before setting off to analyze its 20th and 21st-century manifestations. Throughout the course, our main goal will be to examine the ways in which these thinkers conceive of and perform the role of a “public intellectual.” How do they balance the tasks of documenting and participating in the historical events they describe? What strategies do they utilize in order to relay their intellectual activity to a larger public? What do they consider to be the responsibility of intellectuals?|Kaitlyn Tucker|TBA|The Intelligentsia:  On Slavic Social Thought|1|[54336]|[]|LEC

In this course we try to understand these emotional attachments by examining the narrative of loss and redemption through which most nations in the Balkans retell their Ottoman past. We begin by considering the mythic temporality of the Romantic national narrative while focusing on specific national literary texts where the national past is retold through the formula of original wholeness, foreign invasion, Passion, and Salvation. We then proceed to unpack the structural role of the different elements of that narrative. With the help of Žižek’s theory of the subject as constituted by trauma, we think about the national fixation on the trauma of loss, and the role of trauma in the formation of national consciousness. Specific theme inquiries involve the figure of the Janissary as self and other, brotherhood and fratricide, and the writing of the national trauma on the individual physical body. Special attention is given to the general aesthetic of victimhood, the casting of the victimized national self as the object of the “other’s perverse desire.” With the help of Freud, Žižek, and Kant we consider the transformation of national victimhood into the sublimity of the national self. The main primary texts include Petar Njegoš’ Mountain Wreath (Serbia and Montenegro), Ismail Kadare’s The Castle (Albania), Anton Donchev’s Time of Parting (Bulgaria).|Angelina Ilieva|Foster Hall 408|The Burden of History: The Nation and Its Lost Paradise|1|[42377]|[]|LEC

Nor, despite long-standing stereotypes to the contrary, has it only been the privilege of the elites to disrupt the traditional male-female binary. Readings will address such themes as the ways in which gender defines patterns in family life, in politics and under the law; marriage and homosexuality; prostitution and trafficking; performance and cross dressing; the implementation of the one child policy; gender roles in minority communities; and China's handling of HIV/AIDS. We will consider the role of old Confucian hierarchies and scrutinize the links between industrialization, women's liberation, nationalism, and the communist movement. Through these diverse topics, this seminar aims to expand students' conception of the areas in which gender plays a relevant and influential role."|Johanna Ransmeier|TBA|Gender and Sexuality in Modern China|1|[42907]|[]|SEM

Issues to be explored include the configuration of urban space and its transformation over time in relation to issues of status, class, and political authority; the formation of the ""city person"" as a form of identity; and the tensions between the real city of lived experience and the imagined city of art and literature. We will pay particular attention to two periods of transformation, the 1870s when the modernizing state made Tokyo its capital, and the period of reconstruction after the devastating earthquake of 1923.

HIST35506|Graduate|Open|Tue : 12:00 PM-02:50 PM|One can distinguish four ways in which science and aesthetics are related during the period since the Renaissance. First, science has been the subject of artistic representation, in painting and photography, in poetry and novels (e.g., in Byron’s poetry, for example). Second, science has been used to explain aesthetic effects (e.g., Helmholtz’s work on the way painters achieve visual effects or musicians achieve tonal effects). Third, aesthetic means have been used to convey scientific conceptions (e.g., through illustrations in scientific volumes or through aesthetically affective and effective writing). Finally, philosophers have stepped back to consider the relationship between scientific knowing and aesthetic comprehension (e.g., Kant, Bas van Fraassen); much of the discussion of this latter will focus on the relation between images and what they represent. In this lecture-discussion course we will consider all of these aspects of the science-aesthetic connection.|Robert Richards|TBA|Science and Aesthetics in the 18th-21st Centuries|1|[42921]|[]|SEM

This course will focus on a number of medieval women writers, dealing mainly albeit not exclusively with vernacular texts. After a historical overview of the position of women in the early Middle Ages, the course will focus on Heloise and Hildegard of Bingen as transitional figures, and continue with four women writers writing in the vernacular, i.e., Mechtild of Magdeburg, Hadewijch, Marguerite Porete and Julian of Norwich. The course will link the spectrum of vernacular languages which they represent to the diversity of their individual positions and analyze that diversity in terms of ecclesiastical developments, gender division, authorial identity, and theological criticism.

HIST64202|Graduate|Open|Wed : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|"How do we know what we know about ancient religions? Historians of religion often begin by turning to texts: either sacred texts, or, in the absence of such scriptures, descriptions of belief and practice by observers from outside the faith. Archaeologists focus their attention on the spaces and traces of religious practice—or at least those that survive—while art historians begin by examining images of deities and religious rites. Yet we often fail to see the extent to which the questions which we ask of all of these diverse sources are conditioned by Christian rhetoric about pagan worship. In this course, we compare two moments when Christians encountered ""pagans"": during the initial Christian construction of a discourse on paganism (and, more broadly, a discourse on religion) during the late Roman empire and during the Spanish discovery of the New World. Our course examines silences and absences in the textual and material records, as well as the divergences between texts and objects, in order to further our understanding of ancient religious practice. We will begin to see the many ways in which, as scholars of religion, we are in effect still Christian theologians, paving the way for new approaches to the study of ancient religion."|Clifford Ando, Claudia Brittenham|Regenstein Library 207|The Discovery of Paganism|1|[43843]|[]|SEM

HREL40301|Graduate|Open|Wed : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|"How do we know what we know about ancient religions? Historians of religion often begin by turning to texts: either sacred texts, or, in the absence of such scriptures, descriptions of belief and practice by observers from outside the faith. Archaeologists focus their attention on the spaces and traces of religious practice—or at least those that survive—while art historians begin by examining images of deities and religious rites. Yet we often fail to see the extent to which the questions which we ask of all of these diverse sources are conditioned by Christian rhetoric about pagan worship. In this course, we compare two moments when Christians encountered ""pagans"": during the initial Christian construction of a discourse on paganism (and, more broadly, a discourse on religion) during the late Roman empire and during the Spanish discovery of the New World. Our course examines silences and absences in the textual and material records, as well as the divergences between texts and objects, in order to further our understanding of ancient religious practice. We will begin to see the many ways in which, as scholars of religion, we are in effect still Christian theologians, paving the way for new approaches to the study of ancient religion."|Clifford Ando, Claudia Brittenham|Regenstein Library 207|The Discovery of Paganism|1|[43844]|[]|SEM

While wisdom has received less scholarly attention in modern times, it has recently re-emerged in popular discourse with a growing recognition of its potential importance for addressing complex issues in many domains. But what is wisdom? It’s often used with a meaning more akin to ""smart"" or ""clever."" Is it just vast knowledge? This course will examine the nature of wisdom—how it has been defined, how its meaning has changed, and what its essential components might be. We will examine how current psychological theories conceptualize wisdom and consider whether, and how, wisdom can be studied scientifically; that is, can wisdom be measured and experimentally manipulated to illuminate its underlying mechanisms and understand its functions? Finally, we will explore how concepts of wisdom can be applied in business, education, medicine, the law, and in the course of our everyday lives.

First, students will replace purely metaphorical (and vague) talk of networks with focused propositions about the network properties and dynamics of contemporary phenomena such as international hierarchy, regional fragmentation amidst global integration, and the fate of sovereign territoriality in an age of (violent) transnational activism. Second, students will ponder competing explanations of the network turn in IPE: have IPE scholars abandoned conventional analytical tools in favor of network theory, because the conventional toolkit already came with rudimentary network-theoretic devices that simply needed sharpening; or did some changes in the real international economy prompt the shift? Finally, students will critically assess the ability of SNT to be a vehicle for innovative social science.

ITAL23502|Undergraduate|Open|Mon : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|One of the most important and influential works of the middle ages—and a lot funnier than the Divine Comedy. Boccaccio’s Decameron, written in the midst of the social disruption caused by the Black Death (1348), may have held readers attention for centuries because of its bawdiness, but it is also a profound exploration into the basis of faith and the meaning of death, the status of language, the construction of social hierarchy and social order, and the nature of crisis and historical change. Framed by a story telling contest between seven young ladies and three young men who have left the city to avoid the plague, the one hundred stories of the Decameron form a structural masterpiece that anticipates Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales, the Renaissance epics, and the modern short story. We will especially focus on how the work explores the intersection of legal and literary representation but students will be encouraged to further explore in individual projects the many topics raised by the text, including (and in addition to the themes mentioned above) magic, the visual arts, mercantile culture, travel and discovery, and new religious practices.|Justin Steinberg|TBA|Boccaccio's Decameron|1|[54800]|[]|SEM

Making extensive use of Jewish law and customary practice, cookbooks, etiquette guides, prints, films, novels, maps, memoirs, architectural drawings and photographs, and tourist guides, this course will analyze how Jews (in all their diversity) and non-Jews defined Jewish spaces and places. The focus will be on Europe in the 19th and 20th centuries, but we will also venture back into the early modern period and across the Mediterranean to Palestine/Israel and North Africa, and across the Atlantic to the Caribbean and the Americas. We will study both actually existing structures—synagogues, ritual baths, schools, kosher (and kosher-style) butcher shops, bakeries and restaurants, social and political clubs, hospitals, orphanages, old age homes, museums, and memorials—but also texts and visual culture in which Jewish places and spaces are imagined or vilified. Parallel to our work with primary sources we will read in the recent, very rich, scholarly literature on this topic. This is not a survey course; we will undertake a series of intensive case-studies through which we will address the larger issues.

First, science has been the subject of artistic representation, in painting and photography, in poetry and novels (e.g., in Byron’s poetry, for example). Second, science has been used to explain aesthetic effects (e.g., Helmholtz’s work on the way painters achieve visual effects or musicians achieve tonal effects). Third, aesthetic means have been used to convey scientific conceptions (e.g., through illustrations in scientific volumes or through aesthetically affective and effective writing). Finally, philosophers have stepped back to consider the relationship between scientific knowing and aesthetic comprehension (e.g., Kant, Bas van Fraassen); much of the discussion of this latter will focus on the relation between images and what they represent.

KNOW40301|Graduate|Open|Wed : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|"How do we know what we know about ancient religions? Historians of religion often begin by turning to texts: either sacred texts, or, in the absence of such scriptures, descriptions of belief and practice by observers from outside the faith. Archaeologists focus their attention on the spaces and traces of religious practice—or at least those that survive—while art historians begin by examining images of deities and religious rites. Yet we often fail to see the extent to which the questions which we ask of all of these diverse sources are conditioned by Christian rhetoric about pagan worship. In this course, we compare two moments when Christians encountered ""pagans"": during the initial Christian construction of a discourse on paganism (and, more broadly, a discourse on religion) during the late Roman empire and during the Spanish discovery of the New World. Our course examines silences and absences in the textual and material records, as well as the divergences between texts and objects, in order to further our understanding of ancient religious practice. We will begin to see the many ways in which, as scholars of religion, we are in effect still Christian theologians, paving the way for new approaches to the study of ancient religion."|Clifford Ando, Claudia Brittenham|Regenstein Library 207|The Discovery of Paganism|1|[43845]|[]|SEM

LACS21806|Undergraduate|Open|Fri : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|This course will introduce students to Latin American film studies through an assessment of its most critically celebrated period of radical filmmaking. The New Latin American Cinema (NLAC) of the late 1950s-70s generated unprecedented international enthusiasm for Latin American film production. The filmmakers of this loosely designated movement were defining themselves in relation to global realist film traditions like Italian Neorealism and Griersonian documentary, in relation to--mostly failed-- experiments in building Hollywood-style national film industries, and in relation to regional discourses of underdevelopment and mestizaje. Since the late 1990s, a reassessment of the legacy of the NLAC has been taking shape as scholars have begun to interrogate its canonical status in the face of a changed political climate. In the sphere of filmmaking, contemporary Latin American new wave cinemas are also grappling with that legacy-sometimes disavowing it, sometimes appropriating it. We will situate the NLAC in its historical context, survey its formal achievements and political aspirations, assess its legacy, and take stock of the ways and the reasons that it haunts contemporary production.|Salome Skvirsky|Cobb Hall 311|The New Latin American Cinema and Its Afterlife|1|[54787]|[{'instructor': 'Skvirsky', 'sectionname': 'Section 1S01 [54788] - SCR Open', 'daytime': 'Thu : 03:30 PM-06:30 PM'}]|SEM

This course will examine this three-hundred-year history by investigating the following essential questions: (1) How did a collection of diverse kingdoms manage to create a global empire? (2) What specific factors can explain the Spanish decline of the seventeenth century? (3) Was the Spanish Empire doomed to fail from the very beginning? (4) Why did many colonial subjects remain loyal to Spain after the Conquest and especially after a century of decline? (5) Why did the empire collapse only after 1808? In our exploration of these questions, we will pay particular attention to Spain's ambitious and pioneering, if also destructive, involvement with conquest, colonial exploitation, chattel slavery, racial domination, and a mission to ""civilize"" the world. We will then proceed to investigate the Spanish decline of the seventeenth century and the influence of the emerging empires of Britain, France, and the Dutch Republic. The course concludes by examining Spain's effort to reform its empire during the eighteenth century, interrogating whether this effort alienated Spanish colonial subjects and ultimately contributed to the dissolution of the empire."|Fidel Tavarez|TBA|The Rise and Fall of the Spanish Empire|1|[42931]|[]|SEM

Historians have often relegated Iberia and its New World domains from accounts of the developments of modern science. They have traditionally claimed that strict censorship and a commitment to orthodox Catholicism prevented Spain, once the most powerful empire of the world, from embarking on the path towards scientific modernity in the eighteenth century. Modern scholars, however, have challenged this narrative by embracing more inclusive concepts of ""science"" to explain the many ways in which early modern people related to nature. Some of these practices include the writing of natural histories, botanical research, and linguistic studies, all fields that Iberian scholars pioneered in their efforts to govern their vast domains. This course will introduce students to a diversity of scientific practices that flourished in the Hispanic world between 1400 and 1800."|Valeria Lopez Fadul|TBA|Nature, Science, and Empire in the Early Modern Iberian World, 1400-1800|1|[42929]|[]|SEM

LACS26413|Undergraduate|Open|Tue Thu : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM|“Progress,” and its derived concept of “development” have puzzled Latin Americans throughout their modern history: they were an ambitious goal and a challenge for intellectual and political elites, a reality and an elusive dream for ordinary Latin Americans, and the cause of new challenges and problems wherever they actually or presumably took place. For historians, progress and development used to represent the very sense of universal history, a narrative that sneaked into visions of “Western modernity” and “globalization.” But later on, they became a myth to debunk rather than an object of reflection. What has “progress” meant particularly for Latin Americans? What is, for instance, the meaning of “progress” in the Brazilian flag? How did those notions shape the one of “development” since WWII? In political terms, what ideas of “progress” and “development” animated oligarchic, liberal, populist, military, revolutionary, and democratic projects across the region? Because both concepts involve planning and envisioning the outcome of present actions, the history of progress and development is also, in a certain way, a history of the future. The goal of this seminar is to help students situate a problem of their choice and trace its history in terms of the political debates that pursued the goal of progress and development in that specific realm.|Pablo Palomino|Psychology K114|Progress and Development in Latin America|1|[41611]|[]|LEC

In most democracies, the distribution of wealth among citizens is unequal but the right to vote is universal. Why then have so many newly democratic states transitioned under conditions of high inequality yet failed to redistribute? This course explores this puzzle by analyzing the mechanisms through which individual and group preferences can be translated into pro-poor policies, and the role elites play in influencing a government's capacity or incentives to redistribute wealth. Topics include economic inequality and the demand for redistribution, the difference in redistribution between democracy and dictatorship, the role of globalization in policymaking, and the effects of redistribution on political stability and change.|Michael Albertus|Pick Hall 506|Democracy and the Politics of Wealth Redistribution|1|[41785]|[]|SEM

The New Latin American Cinema (NLAC) of the late 1950s-70s generated unprecedented international enthusiasm for Latin American film production. The filmmakers of this loosely designated movement were defining themselves in relation to global realist film traditions like Italian Neorealism and Griersonian documentary, in relation to--mostly failed-- experiments in building Hollywood-style national film industries, and in relation to regional discourses of underdevelopment and mestizaje. Since the late 1990s, a reassessment of the legacy of the NLAC has been taking shape as scholars have begun to interrogate its canonical status in the face of a changed political climate. In the sphere of filmmaking, contemporary Latin American new wave cinemas are also grappling with that legacy-sometimes disavowing it, sometimes appropriating it. We will situate the NLAC in its historical context, survey its formal achievements and political aspirations, assess its legacy, and take stock of the ways and the reasons that it haunts contemporary production.|Salome Skvirsky|Cobb Hall 311|The New Latin American Cinema and Its Afterlife|1|[54789]|[{'instructor': 'Skvirsky', 'sectionname': 'Section 1S01 [54790] - SCR Open', 'daytime': 'Thu : 03:30 PM-06:30 PM'}]|SEM

LACS40301|Graduate|Open|Wed : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|"How do we know what we know about ancient religions? Historians of religion often begin by turning to texts: either sacred texts, or, in the absence of such scriptures, descriptions of belief and practice by observers from outside the faith. Archaeologists focus their attention on the spaces and traces of religious practice—or at least those that survive—while art historians begin by examining images of deities and religious rites. Yet we often fail to see the extent to which the questions which we ask of all of these diverse sources are conditioned by Christian rhetoric about pagan worship. In this course, we compare two moments when Christians encountered ""pagans"": during the initial Christian construction of a discourse on paganism (and, more broadly, a discourse on religion) during the late Roman empire and during the Spanish discovery of the New World. Our course examines silences and absences in the textual and material records, as well as the divergences between texts and objects, in order to further our understanding of ancient religious practice. We will begin to see the many ways in which, as scholars of religion, we are in effect still Christian theologians, paving the way for new approaches to the study of ancient religion."|Clifford Ando, Claudia Brittenham|Regenstein Library 207|The Discovery of Paganism|1|[43846]|[]|SEM

LAWS42501|Law School|Closed|Mon Wed Thu : 09:45 AM-10:50 AM|(BID, CORE) This course provides an overview of the application to law of the basic principles of corporate finance and financial economics. Topics include the concept of discounting and present value, portfolio theory and diversification, the theory of efficient capital markets and its applications in securities litigation, corporate capital structure and bond covenants, and the analysis of options and other derivative instruments. The principles and concepts of corporate finance are essential to understanding modern corporate transactions. Increasingly, lawyers must understand these principles in order to structure transactions in ways that achieve particular business objectives. The concepts in this class are also of great value to lawyers outside the corporate area: financial principles can be fruitfully applied to a wide variety of legal questions, ranging from estate planning to the calculation of tort awards. This class assumes no background in finance, and is aimed primarily at students with little or no prior exposure to the field (rather than those with an MBA or with an undergraduate finance major). It does not use any mathematics beyond basic arithmetic and some simple algebra.|Dhammika Dharmapala|Laird Bell Quadrangle F|Corporate Finance|01|[40596]|[]|CRS
LAWS42603|Law School|Open|Mon : 08:30 AM-11:40 AM|"(++, BID, CORE, DOC) This course uses the case method to study the practical aspects of important topics in corporate and entrepreneurial finance. We will apply the concepts and techniques of corporate finance to actual situations. The course is roughly divided into three sections: (1) financing decisions; (2) investment decisions; (3) entrepreneurial finance; and (4) private equity finance. In addition to analyzing the specific financing problems or issues, we will consider how those issues relate to the strategic objectives of the firm. It will be important to examine the ""big picture"" assumptions that are used in the numerical calculations. This course also places a strong emphasis on presentation and discussion skills. It will be important to explain your positions or arguments to each other and to try to argue for the implementation of your recommendations. COURSE PROCEDURES For each class meeting, I will assign study questions concerning one or two case studies. For most of the class period, we will consider the questions and the material in the cases. This includes the first meeting. You are allowed and encouraged, but not required to meet in groups outside of class to discuss and analyze the cases. Each group will submit a two-page memorandum of analysis and recommendations at the beginning of each case discussion. If you are working in a group, I will accept one memorandum from the group and count it for all students in the group. If you choose to do this, the group can include up to 3 students. Each memorandum should be typed and double-spaced. Write these as if you were writing a recommendation to the CEO or major decision maker in the case. The two page limit is for text only. You may attach as many numerical calculations as you wish. Memoranda will not be accepted after the class has met. A memorandum will be given credit if it is handed in and no credit if it is not. Initially, therefore, I will not grade them. However, I will use the memoranda to determine final grades for those students who are on the border of two grades. You should prepare a memorandum for UST, the first class. The readings and articles that I have assigned and will hand out are largely non-technical in nature and summarize the findings of academic research in corporate finance in the recent past. These articles are meant to be background material that will help you analyze the cases. They should not necessarily be cited in the case discussion. You should argue as if you were in a corporate boardroom rather than in a doctoral seminar. The process of arriving at the answer is as important as getting the answer. Because of the nature of this course (and its grading criteria), it is extremely important that you attend every class, arrive on time and be prepared to participate. To help me out, you should bring your name cards to each class. I may not remember who said what without those cards. In the past, students have asked me to hand out my case analysis after the class has discussed the case. I will not do this, because there are usually no absolute right answers. The best cases are deliberately written to be ambiguous. While there are no right answers, there are good arguments and bad arguments. This course is designed to help you learn to distinguish between sensible and senseless arguments. Handing out my analyses would reduce the ambiguity in the cases and partially defeat the purpose of doing cases. If you are uncomfortable with ambiguity, this class may not be for you. PREREQUISITE Students should have an understanding of financial statements. I.e., students should be able to read an income statement, cash flow statement and balance sheet."|Steven Neil Kaplan|Laird Bell Quadrangle D|Corporate and Entrepreneurial Finance|01|[40595]|[]|CRS
LAWS42801|Law School|Open|Mon Wed Thu : 01:30 PM-02:35 PM|(BID, CORE) This course is a one-quarter survey of antitrust law. It is designed for students with diverse interests and practice plans. The course should be as valuable to the general business lawyer and the legally trained private equity investor or investment banker as it is to the litigator. There is no assumption of advanced skill or training in economics and no complex mathematical or economic tools are required. Antitrust has been defined not by rulemaking and statutory expansion, but by judges deciding cases, one at a time, in the common law tradition, in large part because the antitrust statutes are very terse and compact (unlike statues in other business fields such as securities regulation, banking regulation and the regulation of telecommunications). Most antitrust issues have been back and forth to the Supreme Court repeatedly. This allows students to see how succeeding generations of great judges have wrestled with the core issues in the field. For these reasons, the great beauty of antitrust is to see it as, essentially, a common law subject, evolving and adapting over its 120-year history. We will do that by reading and studying the wonderful opinions that enliven this field.|Andrew Rosenfield|Laird Bell Quadrangle F|Antitrust Law|01|[40579]|[]|CRS

In 1969, the Supreme Court famously declared that students do not ""shed their constitutional rights when they enter the schoolhouse gate."" Not surprisingly, though, Supreme Court Justices both before and since have bitterly contested the precise scope of students' constitutional rights in the elementary and secondary school contexts. Some Justices, moreover, have concluded that it is typically unwise for the judiciary to enter the educational realm, lest the Supreme Court turn into a schoolboard for the entire nation. Even if such fears are overblown, however, there can be no doubt that the Court's constitutional interpretations have had significant consequences for schools charged with transforming students into citizens. Constitutional topics will include: freedom of speech, establishment of religion, free exercise of religion, searches and seizures, cruel and unusual punishment, due process, and equal protection. Educational topics will include: homeschooling, zero tolerance policies, corporal punishment, school funding, school uniforms, racial desegregation, strip searches, single-sex schools, off campus speech, drug testing, unauthorized immigration, the school-to-prison pipeline, and book banning.

LAWS43248|Law School|List|Tue : 09:45 AM-01:15 PM|(++, SKLL, BID, CORE, DOC) This course is designed to refresh your knowledge of basic financial accounting [first two weeks of class] and then aims to aggressively increase your ability to be a highly sophisticated user of financial statements. After taking this course, you should improve your ability to determine a firm's accounting policy for a particular type of transaction and to determine how that policy choice affects its primary financial statements. You will also learn how to question whether these effects fairly reflect the underlying economics of the firm's transactions. Asking these questions involves an interplay between accounting, economics, finance, law and business strategy. You should therefore greatly improve your ability to use an accounting report as part of an overall assessment of the firm's strategy and the potential rewards and risks of dealing with the firm. The teaching approach will be a roughly equal combination of lecture time and demanding case applications of the lecture material that will involve group case assignments that will form the basis for in-class discussion of the cases. The technical knowledge acquired from the lecture material is applied to cases where the main goal is to examine how the reported financial statements would differ if the firm had used different accounting policies. The focus is on modifying the reported financial statements in order to obtain the cleanest possible inputs for use in such applications as equity valuation, transaction structuring and credit analysis. The topics to be discussed are likely to include the accounting for, and interpretation of: revenue recognition, intercorporate investments, organizational structures (e.g., franchising), debt, and leases. Intensive group hand-in cases will be used to illustrate how the flexibility in financial reporting can reflect both the economics of the firm and the incentives of the managers creating the financial statements. It is REQUIRED that students registering for this course have prior exposure to accounting course work, at least at the level of Fundamentals of Accounting for Attorneys (LAWS 79112 or 53260), but with a strong preference for the stronger background knowledge provided by the Booth course Financial Accounting (B30000).|Philip Berger|Laird Bell Quadrangle E|Accounting and Financial Analysis|01|[40571]|[]|CRS

It involves a transaction in which an investor in one country (home state) sends capital to another (host state). But in many cases the transaction is subject to what is called in economics a dynamic inconsistency problem, in which the host state’s incentives change once the investment is sunk, and it may want to renege on its promises to the investor. Furthermore, neither side is likely to want any disputes adjudicated in the courts of the other’s country. The global investment regime has arisen to help resolve these problems. The regime includes bilateral investment treaties (known as BITs) as well as multilateral agreements that are embedded in broader treaty structures, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) or the Energy Charter Treaty. This seminar will introduce students to the operation of the investment law regime, with an emphasis on the tensions between home and host states, the impact of the regime on development outcomes, and the relationship between law and arbitration.

LAWS47411|Law School|Open|Tue Fri : 01:30 PM-03:15 PM|(1E, BID, CORE) An examination of classic jurisprudential questions in and around the theory of adjudication: the theory of how judges actually do decide cases and how they ought to decide them. These questions include: Do legal rules really constrain judicial decision-making? What makes a rule (or norm) a rule of the legal system? Are principles of morality legally binding even when such principles have not been enacted into a law by a legislature? (Relatedly, are there objective principles of morality?) When no legal norm controls a case, how ought judges to decide that case? Can there be right answers to legal disputes, even when informed judges and lawyers disagree about the answer? Are there principles or methods of legal reasoning that constrain judicial decision-making, or is legal reasoning essentially indeterminate, such that a skillful judge can justify more than one outcome for any given dispute? Is judicial decision-making really distinct from political decision-making of the sort legislators engage in? Readings drawn exclusively from major twentieth-century schools of thought - especially American Legal Realism (e.g., Karl Llewellyn, Jerome Frank), Natural Law (e.g., Ronald Dworkin, John Finnis), and Legal Positivism (e.g., H.L.A. Hart, Joseph Raz) - supplemented by other pertinent readings (from Leslie Green, Richard Posner, and the instructor, among others). No familiarity with either jurisprudence or philosophy will be presupposed, though some readings will be philosophically demanding, and the course will sometimes venture into (and explain) cognate philosophical issues in philosophy of language and metaethics as they are relevant to the core jurisprudential questions. Attendance at the first session is mandatory for those who want to enroll.

After studying some key historical texts in the Western tradition (Wollstonecraft, Rousseau, J. S. Mill), we examine four types of contemporary philosophical feminism: Liberal Feminism (Susan Moller Okin, Martha Nussbaum), Radical Feminism (Catharine MacKinnon, Andrea Dworkin), Difference Feminism (Carol Gilligan, Annette Baier, Nel Noddings), and Postmodern ""Queer"" Gender Theory (Judith Butler, Michael Warner). After studying each of these approaches, we will focus on political and ethical problems of contemporary international feminism, asking how well each of the approaches addresses these problems.

Both types of transactions may raise conflict of interest issues because some of the company's directors or officers, who are charged with protecting the public shareholders, may be accused of having interests adverse to those of the public shareholders. We will examine the methods that Delaware law has provided for dealing with these possible conflicts of interest and the consequences of employing these methods. We will also look at some other issues raised by going private transactions and certain conflict and other issues that can arise in transactions even if they are neither controlling shareholder buyouts nor buyouts involving the company’s management. Finally, we will examine the role of the financial advisors and lawyers who are involved in these transactions.

We will examine the substantive criminal laws and sentencing schemes used in the best public corruption prosecutions, ranging from RICO and ""honest services"" fraud to bribery and extortion laws. We will also examine the laws that create, authorize, or prevent the most effective investigative tools used by law enforcement against public corruption, including wiretap laws and related privacy issues. We will study several key topics within public corruption law, including patronage, its effect on democratic institutions, and its status under the First Amendment; campaign finance reform and whether money in campaigns is protected speech or a corrupting influence (or both); and the relationship between transparency, online access to information, and corruption. We will also consider an economic analysis of public corruption, including questions about whether the level of democracy, and the pervasiveness of corruption in the culture, affect the cost-benefit analysis.

Such adversaries may include foreign intelligence services, terrorists, foreign criminal enterprises, cyber intruders, or some combination thereof. The seminar will consider both legal and policy issues raised in efforts to prevent adversarial espionage action -- overt, covert, or clandestine -- targeting US military, diplomatic, and economic interests at home and abroad. The seminar will also explore the role and overlap of covert action, roughly defined as action intended to influence events in another nation or territory without revealing the involvement of the sponsor. Although the primary focus of the seminar will be separation of powers issues and the role of executive power in counterintelligence and covert action, care will be taken to consider less frequently discussed implications for domestic and international economies and markets, as well as the extent to which economic and market considerations motivate policy making or legal decisions. The seminar will include short case studies from the Cold War and post-Cold War eras in the US, Latin America, the Middle East, and the former USSR. The seminar is designed to minimize overlap with the material covered in The Law of Counterterrorism (LAWS 70704 or 43221) and National Security Issues (LAWS 70703 or 53217) by primarily focusing attention on state actors rather than nonstate actors.

Throughout the seminar, different products designed to achieve similar economic goals will be examined to highlight the significance of structuring choices and the range of techniques available. For example, there are various products that can be used to approximate the economics of buying an asset, without an actual purchase of that asset. The seminar will examine how these products are treated differently for tax, securities law, commodities law, bankruptcy, accounting and other purposes, notwithstanding their economic similarity. Students will develop the ability to optimize transactions by selecting among existing financial instruments or inventing new ones. The seminar will also include discussion of policy issues.

LAWS53281|Law School|Open|Fri : 09:45 AM-11:45 AM|(BID, LEC, SEM, WP) The United States and China appear to be heading toward an era of confrontation rather than cooperation. China is growing stronger and more influential in every domain worldwide and likely to increasingly threaten the status quo. The U.S., meanwhile, finds itself in the grips of a populist movement led by President Trump, who is openly critical of China. The relationship, which was already mistrustful, has grown even more fragile and anxious in recent weeks with talk of tariffs, Taiwan, and the South China Sea. The accusations and threats suggest that we are likely to witness greater turbulence than what we have experienced in the past forty years. The reality is that both nations need each other; both have significant economic, political, and security interests at stake. If the two nations learn how to collaborate, they could conceivably solve the world’s greatest problems. Alternatively, if they elect to contest each other at every turn, the result will be global instability and crisis. Clearly, a new framework for cooperation and collaboration is needed – quite possibly “a new deal,” in the language of President Trump. What will constitute such a deal? How will it work? How likely is a deal, and, if one does occur, will it survive the volatility of an America First foreign policy? This seminar will advocate that the two nations develop a new, fifty-year treaty in the form of a strategic cooperation agreement. We will define the rationale and the case for action, draft major components of the proposed treaty, outline the pathway required for adoption, and transmit our end-product to foreign policy authorities in Washington and Beijing. Grading will be determined by class participation and by performance across three short papers. The first paper will examine best practices in bilateral treaty development; the second will focus on critical factors in the future United States - China relationship; and, the third will require drafting of key components for the proposed treaty.|Tom Manning|Laird Bell Quadrangle C|The US-China Treaty Project|01|[40636]|[]|SEM

LAWS53317|Law School|List|Mon : 04:00 PM-06:00 PM|(BID, LEC, SIM) Since the financial crisis of 2008, regulators and prosecutors around the world increasingly expect companies to have state of the art governance, risk and compliance programs as a condition for remaining in business and for avoiding liabilities for regulatory missteps. Increasingly, regulatory rules are becoming more complex and authorities are becoming more unforgiving, with stepped up efforts to secure criminal and civil penalties against companies, their executives, lawyers and auditors. For companies, such liability can at best result in plummeting share prices, and at worst the shutting down of an enterprise. For individuals, they can result in incarceration, fines, penalties and removal from the business. While many of the principles apply to all industries, the seminar will explore the regulatory and legal foundations for these programs primarily through the lens of the financial services sector, which includes banks, brokerage firms, investment companies and investment advisers. We will also explore how the design and execution of these programs can avoid or limit potential liabilities from regulatory and criminal authorities. From the perspective of a corporate executive, board member or counsel, students will develop the ability to understand the fundamentals of regulatory regimes overseeing these businesses, as well as strategies for successfully engaging the regulators. Students will consider the steps a firm should take to mitigate regulatory and reputation risk, including the importance of an effective corporate ethics program, as well as how, in the process, a firm can enhance its brand, meet the expectations of its board of directors and create value for its shareholders.|Charles Senatore|Laird Bell Quadrangle E|Compliance and Regulatory Strategy|01|[40589]|[]|SIM

LAWS53359|Law School|Closed|Fri : 09:45 AM-11:45 AM|(++, A) This practicum is designed to give students first hand experience with the complex challenges and unique opportunities present in the everyday work of contemporary tribal legal systems. Students will serve as law clerks to justices of the Hopi Appellate Court, doing legal research, writing bench memoranda, and drafting opinions on live cases. Students will do all their coursework and assigned casework at the University of Chicago with site visits to the respective Hopi legal institutions to attend oral arguments, present findings to Hopi tribal officials, and participate in judicial deliberations. In so doing, they will be directly involved in testing the socio-legal principles, theories and critiques they explore in class in the crucible of the work they do helping to lay the regulatory and legal foundations for Hopi tribal institutions. In this practicum, almost every project that a student will work on will involve important questions of first impression with respect to a wide variety of pressing, yet enduring sociolegal issues, including issues of constitutionalism (separations of powers, checks and balances, etc.), crime and punishment (criminal law enforcement and defendants' and victims' rights), civil procedure (due process, appellate procedure, motions and orders), private law (property, contract, family), pluralism (the role of Anglo-American vs. Hopi traditional norms, and alternative dispute resolution), among many others. Given the centrality of these issues to the philosophy, social science, and practice of law - whether in the context of indigenous self-governance and settler colonialism, or otherwise -we believe that there are few other opportunities like this one, where students will encounter, explore and work through, the profound governance and legal issues and discussions offered by the Hopi Tribal Law Practicum.|M.

In addition to situating the Chinese legal materials in their varying legal, social, political, cultural and historical contexts, and thereby highlighting some of their unique elements, the course also familiarizes students with a wide range of theoretical materials (eg., anthropological, legal philosophical, economic, etc.) which may be useful in bringing to light any universalities of legal systems and behavior. However, discussion of any given text will be directed in large part by the nature and contents of the material itself. The Chinese materials, all readings of which will be in translation, range from commemorative inscriptions cast in bronze sacral vessels and descriptions of legal practices in received texts, to actual statutes and case records, philosophical texts and legal debates. The medium, discovery/transmission, and authorship of each document will be given due consideration for the effect they may have on our understanding of the contemporary legal context from which the text derives. The course culminates with student presentations on the material of their choice. Preparation for presentations will be conducted in consult with the instructor. Students are encouraged to draw from their study of other legal systems and/or systems of legal thought (both modern and pre-modern) in their discussion of the ancient Chinese material. It is hoped that the course will help students question their own assumptions about legal behavior, and the nature and role of law and legal systems in early China, specifically, and within the human world, generally.

For each type of agreement, we will begin with an examination of a model agreement and a discussion of significant issues that tend to be present. The members of the class will then have a simulated negotiation based on written hypothetical situations in which they will be attempting to reach an agreement and negotiate contractual language that would be part of the type of agreement at issue. In the simulated negotiation for each type of agreement all members of the class will be identified as counsel or a business representative for either (a) the buyer or (b) the target or the seller. The class will be divided into four groups, two (Group 1 and Group 2) for the buyer and two (Group 3 and Group 4) for the target or seller. Group 1 will negotiate with Group 3. Group 2 will separately negotiate with Group 4. Groups 1 and 3 will not communicate with Groups 2 and 4. Each student will be counsel to a party at least once. We will also have short discussions about negotiation ethics and about negotiating and drafting. Grades will be based on: (i) two three to five page papers describing the student’s negotiating experience for each agreement, and what the student would do differently in the future; (ii) classroom performance; and (iii) the contractual language submitted for each agreement (or what they proposed if no agreement is reached).

LAWS53375|Law School|Open|Thu : 09:45 AM-11:45 AM|(++, BID, CORE, SEM, SRP) In this seminar we shall explore some key concepts in corporate law from a theoretical (i.e. non-doctrinal) perspective. The materials will borrow heavily from the economic, psychological, financial and accounting literature. By the same token no formal education in either of these disciplines or in math is expected. Doctrinal materials will be treated as empirical observations. For instance, we might note that a given judicial dictum was made by some court as one notes the occurrence of facts, but then explore whether that dictum generates an optimal result. The seminar will be divided in two parts. During approximately the first half of the quarter I shall deliver introductory lectures. In the second half the students will make oral presentations on topics of their choice, which naturally will pertain to the subject of the seminar. Prior to making those presentations the students will be expected to consult with me in order to make sure that their respective presentations are going in the right direction.

LAWS53391|Law School|Closed|Tue : 04:00 PM-06:00 PM|(++, LEC, SEM, SKLL, WP) This seminar is designed to closely replicate the actual responsibilities of a law clerk to a United States Supreme Court Justice. The first class will take the form of an interview. Prospective clerks will face a range of questions designed to test their approach to statutory and constitutional interpretation while gauging their familiarity with pending, recent, and seminal cases. (You will all be hired!) In subsequent classes, clerks will: (1) circulate and review cert-pool memos for actual, pending petitions for writs of certiorari. These memos help the full Court determine which cases to hear on the merits; (2) review merits briefs and write a bench memo to assist your Justice at oral argument and at Conference (where the Justices meet to resolve argued matters); (3) draft a judicial opinion assigned to your Justice (which may well entail a judgment or legal reasoning the clerk does not agree with); and (4) lead class discussion and debate for the cert-pool and merits cases for which the clerk took primary responsibility. Over the course of the seminar, each clerk will write three cert-pool memos, one bench memo, and one opinion. The seminar is aimed at students who have or seek a state or federal clerkship and those with a possible interest in clerking for a U.S. Supreme Court Justice. A firm background in constitutional law is strongly recommended, and your open-minded Justice seeks applicants with a wide array of political and jurisprudential perspectives. Grades will be based on a combination of draft opinions, class participation, cert-pool memos, and bench memos. Students may only enroll with the permission of the instructor. Students interested in enrolling should email Mr. Keller (akeller@uchicago.edu) and submit a resume and a short statement of interest explaining why they would like to enroll in the seminar no later than February 17, 2017.

While Trump’s supporters celebrated the victory of their candidate, many of Trump’s critics argued that Trump’s election was illegitimate, and demonstrators took to the streets. Even after a short time in office, Trump’s actions have—according to his critics—showed a profound indifference to democratic institutions. They complain that he has violated constitutional norms by retaining his business ties, issuing aggressive executive orders, and attacking the press, among other actions. But are the critics right? Is Trump a normal president or a constitutional aberration? We will examine these questions from the standpoint of law, history, and political theory.

LAWS53393|Law School|Open|Wed : 04:00 PM-06:00 PM|(BID, LEC, SEM) After Obama’s historical election, many declared that the United States had finally become a post-racial nation. The assumption was that if the country could elect a black President, then surely racism and prejudice were evils of the past. But then came the killings of Freddie Gray, Michael Brown, Sandra Bland, Eric Garner and others, and the community responses in Ferguson, Baltimore, and other cities across the country. These events, in turn, led to several criminal trials and federal investigations, and showed the salience of race in the operation of the criminal justice system. The assertion that “Black Lives Matter” became a rallying cry, and what started as a hashtag turned into a movement. This seminar will examine the role of law in creating and recreating race in our decidedly non-post-racial society. Topics covered will include racial identity, education, and criminal justice. Readings will include cases to understand the “law on the books;” law review articles to understand how legal academics interact the law and its implications; and social science research to understand “law in action.” Students will be evaluated as follows. For 2 credits, students will write three response papers, 4-5 pages each, on 3 different set of readings, due the day before that class meets.

The litigators (and corporate lawyers) who concentrate in this area must function in an environment where the stakes are high, leverage is critical, and “victory” is defined by the client, not the court. Accordingly, this seminar examines the critical questions faced in virtually every financial services litigation matter including: (1) which is the most favorable venue for this litigation, including consideration of how legal principles vary jurisdiction by jurisdiction; (2) how does Directors and Officers Liability insurance impact the litigation, itself; (3) strategic considerations relating to the composition of the board and use of special litigation committees; (4) how dispositive motions can be used to, at a minimum, best frame and limit the litigation; (5) how derivative and class certification mechanisms can be used to narrow or defeat claims; (6) how to use the timing and positioning of mediation to produce a favorable result for the client; (7) who of your pool of potential experts should be identified, on what topics, and when to maximize chances of success; and (8) what is jury research and what role does it play in making thematic and settlement decisions. To further the student experience, we will supplement our sessions by bringing some of the nation’s top litigators and practioners in fields like jury research, D&O insurance, mediation and/or damage analysis to share their years of expertise drawn from real world situations.

The readings will consist of a healthy mix of public law and private law, and various scholarly methodologies. During the Autumn quarter, students will have short research and writing assignments on the readings. Students will also work with faculty to identify a topic for a substantial research paper. During the Winter quarter, the seminar will not meet in formal sessions, but each student will work on his or her research paper and will meet individually with the instructors to assess the paper’s progress. During the Spring quarter, the seminar will reconvene, and students will workshop their drafts (i.e., each student will circulate his or her draft in advance and answer questions from students and faculty). Students will receive an Autumn quarter grade based on their short writing assignments, discussion facilitation, and class participation. Students will receive a separate grade for the Winter and Spring quarters based on the quality of their research papers and class participation.

In the process, we enjoy many opportunities to explore whether and how program structures reflect or reinforce prevailing cultural attitudes and assumptions about program participants including attitudes and assumptions based on gender and race.

It admits approximately ten students. Its aim is to study, each year, a topic that arises in both philosophy and the law and to ask how bringing the two fields together may yield mutual illumination. Most sessions are led by visiting speakers, from either outside institutions or our own faculty, who circulate their papers in advance. The session consists of a brief introduction by the speaker, followed by initial questioning by the two faculty coordinators, followed by general discussion, in which students are given priority. The topic for 2016-17 will expose students to cutting-edge work in general jurisprudence, that part of philosophy of law concerned with the central questions about the nature of law, the relationship between law and morality, and the nature of legal reasoning. We will be particularly interested in the way in which work in philosophy of language, metaethics, metaphysics, and other cognate fields of philosophy has influenced recent scholarly debates that have arisen in the wake of H.L.A. Hart’s seminal The Concept of Law (1961). Please see www.law.uchicago.edu/workshops/lawandphilosophy for additional information concerning each session. Usual participants include graduate students in philosophy, political science, and divinity, and law students. Students write a 20-25 page seminar paper at the end of the year.

Students in the clinic are appointed by the federal government as Child Advocate (similar to a guardian ad litem) for unaccompanied immigrant children detained in Chicago. Unaccompanied immigrant children come to the U.S. from all corners of the world, on their own. They are apprehended—typically at the U.S./Mexico border—then detained and placed in deportation proceedings. Direct Client Service: Pursuant to federal law, the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, the Young Center is appointed as Child Advocate for the most vulnerable of these children (tender age children, children with mental or physical disabilities, children who have experienced extensive trauma, etc.). Law students serve as Child Advocate for individual children, and are responsible for advocating for the best interests of the assigned child on issues relating to safe repatriation, legal relief, care, custody and release. Each student meets weekly with the child at the detention facility, and advocates on behalf of the child with federal officials, including immigration judges and asylum officers, under the supervision of Young Center attorneys. Since there currently is no substantive best interests of the child standard under the Immigration and Nationality Act, students look to international human rights law, including the Convention on the Rights of the Child, state child welfare law, and the child protection laws of the child’s home country. Policy Advocacy: In addition to serving as Child Advocate, clinic students have the opportunity to engage in legislative and policy advocacy aimed at improving the immigration system for children in removal proceedings. This is an especially critical time since the government projects 70,000 children will arrive at the border this year. Young Center students will do policy advocacy aimed at reforming procedural and substantive legal protections, including the appointment of counsel for immigrant children and incorporation of a substantive best interests of the child standard in the Immigration and Nationality Act.

The Clinic focuses primarily on pre-trial litigation and handles a number of individual cases and class actions. In individual cases, the Clinic represents clients in cases before the Illinois Department of Human Rights and the Illinois Human Rights Commission and seeks to obtain relief for clients from race, sex, national origin, and handicap discrimination in the work place. In the class actions, the Clinic represents groups of employees in employment and civil rights actions in federal court. Additionally, in its individual cases and law reform/impact cases, the Clinic seeks to improve the procedures and remedies available to victims of employment discrimination so that employees have a fair opportunity to present their claims in a reasonably expeditious way. To accomplish this goal, the Clinic is active in the legislative arena and participates with other civil rights groups in efforts to amend and improve state and federal laws. It is suggested, but not required, that all students in the Employment Law Clinic take the Employment Discrimination Law seminar. It is recommended that third-year students take, prior to their third year, either the Intensive Trial Practice Workshop or some other trial practice course. The student's grade is based on class participation.

LAWS90913|Law School|Closed|TBA|(++, A, SKLL, CLN) The Civil Rights and Police Accountability Project (PAP) is one of the nation’s leading law civil rights clinics focusing on issues of criminal justice. Through the lens of live-client work, students examine how and where litigation fits into broader efforts to improve police accountability and ultimately the criminal justice system. Students provide legal services to indigent victims of police abuse in federal and state courts. They litigate civil rights cases at each level of the court system from trial through appeals. Some students also represent children and adults in related juvenile or criminal defense matters. Students take primary responsibility for all aspects of the litigation, including client counseling, fact investigation, case strategy, witness interviews, legal research, pleadings and legal memoranda, discovery, depositions, motion practice, evidentiary hearings, trials, and appeals. A significant amount of legal writing is expected. Students work in teams on cases or projects, and meet with the instructor on at minimum a weekly basis. Students also take primary responsibility for the Clinic’s policy and public education work. PAP teaches students to apply and critically examine legal theory in the context of representation of people in need. It teaches students to analyze how and why individual cases of abuse occur and to connect them to systemic problems, often leading to “public impact” litigation and other strategies for policy reform. Through our immersion in live client work, we engage fundamental issues of race, class, and gender, and their intersection with legal institutions. We instruct students in legal ethics and advocacy skills. And we seek to instill in them a public service ethos, as they begin their legal careers.

We will situate creoles in the context of the plantation settlement colonies that produced them and compare their emergence specifically with that of languages such as English and the Romance languages in Europe. We will also compare these evolutions with those of new colonial varieties of European languages (such as Amish English, mainstream American English varieties, Brazilian Portuguese, and Québécois French) which emerged around the same time but are not considered creoles. Using the comparative approach (in evolutionary theory), we will assess whether the criteria used in the genetic classification of languages have been applied uniformly to creole and non-creole languages.

Through reading some key texts, we will analyze how disciplines such as economics, linguistics, and anthropology have conceptualized this relationship. Among many topics, we will address issues about language development and language commodification, and about notions such as linguistic market and language as public good. We will explore ways in which linguistics and economics perspectives on the role of language in economic development and that of economic factors in language practices can be mutually enriching.|Cecile Vigouroux|Rosenwald Hall 329|Language and Economy: an Interdisciplinary Approach|1|[43211]|[]|SEM

This course will examine this type of structured heterogeneity (Weinreich et al. 1968) from the point of view of sociophonetics. We will focus on the interrelationships between phonetic/phonological form and social factors such as speaking style and the background of the speaker, with a particular interest in explaining the origins and transmission of linguistic change. Our goals will be to (a) acquire the phonetic and phonological foundation necessary to conduct sociophonetic research through practical exercises; (b) survey new sociolinguistic research that addresses issues in phonetic and phonological theories; and (c) locate and explain phonetic variation in its social context while drawing on current approaches to the relationship between language and society. This course will give students hands-on experience with designing and conducting experiments. As part of the empirical foundation of this course, we will focus on sociophonetic variation across Chicago neighborhoods. For a final project, students are required to conduct a small-scale study investigating a research question of relevance to sociophonetic research.

We will situate creoles in the context of the plantation settlement colonies that produced them and compare their emergence specifically with that of languages such as English and the Romance languages in Europe. We will also compare these evolutions with those of new colonial varieties of European languages (such as Amish English, mainstream American English varieties, Brazilian Portuguese, and Québécois French) which emerged around the same time but are not considered creoles. Using the comparative approach (in evolutionary theory), we will assess whether the criteria used in the genetic classification of languages have been applied uniformly to creole and non-creole languages. In return, we will explore ways in which genetic creolistics can inform and improve genetic linguistics (including historical dialectology).|Salikoko Mufwene|TBA|Creole Genesis and Genetic Linguistics|1|[41837]|[]|LEC

Why then have so many newly democratic states transitioned under conditions of high inequality yet failed to redistribute? This course explores this puzzle by analyzing the mechanisms through which individual and group preferences can be translated into pro-poor policies, and the role elites play in influencing a government's capacity or incentives to redistribute wealth. Topics include economic inequality and the demand for redistribution, the difference in redistribution between democracy and dictatorship, the role of globalization in policymaking, and the effects of redistribution on political stability and change.|Michael Albertus|Pick Hall 506|Democracy and the Politics of Wealth Redistribution|1|[41786]|[]|SEM

While the focus is on spatial aspects, the types of methods covered have general validity in statistical practice. The course covers the specification of spatial regression models in order to incorporate spatial dependence and spatial heterogeneity, as well as different estimation methods and specification tests to detect the presence of spatial autocorrelation and spatial heterogeneity. Special attention is paid to the application to spatial models of generic statistical paradigms, such as Maximum Likelihood, Generalized Methods of Moments and the Bayesian perspective.

We begin by surveying the development and trajectory of the field, particularly as it develops around debates on revolution and compromise, cosmopolitanism, the psychology of colonialism, and anti-colonial historiography. Alongside this, we consider the recent disciplinary revival of the categories of “global Anglophone” and “world literature” through readings on “literary worlds” to to evaluate these categories, and their contributions to ongoing debates about translation/translatability, vernaculars, rewriting, and mimicry. What are the claims made on behalf of literary texts in orienting us to other lives and possibilities, and in registering the experience of geographic and cultural displacement? To better answer this, we read recent scholarship that engages the field in conversations around intimacy, belonging, and human rights, to think about the impulses that animate the field, and its possible futures.

Worrying ourselves into the realm of the pathological, we now have a requisite measure of anxiety for every prescribed stage of life. But why are we so anxious? Considering its prevalence in everyday life, the concept and theories of anxiety have been employed surprisingly seldom as a way into film, fiction, and art. In this course we examine the modern origin of contemporary discourses specific to anxiety and their unique manifestation in cultural artifacts. To understand the complex of anxiety in the so-called Western world, we rely on the theories of Søren Kierkegaard, Martin Heidegger, Sigmund Freud, Jacques Lacan, and Alenka Zupančič; fiction by Stoker, Schnitzler, Kafka, and Sebald; and film by Haneke, Kubrick, Ophuls, and Hitchcock.

MAPH37818|Graduate|Open|Mon Wed : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM|In American popular culture, the eighteenth century is remembered today (to the extent that it is remembered at all) as a heady time of revolutions and revolutionaries, when towering figures of the Enlightenment established modern democracy. This, in many ways, reflects the narrative eighteenth-century writers were developing about their own age. For British Whigs, the “Glorious Revolution” of 1688 had been a watershed moment at which the arbitrary rule of kings had been replaced for all time by constitutionalism; the social contract and the civil polity had triumphed over divine-right ideology, ushering in a new, beneficent era of progress. And, in the 1790s, the French Revolution fired the political imaginations of British radicals who saw the potential for a world made anew – a world of universal suffrage and gender equality, where slavery was abolished. Clearly, attaining these goals was a long way off. The debates over the structures, meanings, and nature of consent had tendrils in multiple areas of society – the law, of course, but also in understandings of sexuality, constructions of gender, economics, and colonization. Questions of rights, agency, and authority (what those categories meant, who could possess them, and who guaranteed them) were by no means settled, and, indeed, throughout the century, calls to curtail the categories of people who should have access to the sphere of political influence were often as boisterous as those to expand such access. This course will explore how a range of authors in eighteenth-century Britain figured questions of consent, rights, and authority and how the ideological debates these authors mediated continue to inform contemporary politics, cultures, and identities. We will read works by literary figures such as Daniel Defoe, Samuel Richardson, Mary Hays, Olaudah Equiano, and Mary Shelley. We will consider the writings of some of the major political philosophers of the day, as well, including John Locke, Thomas Hobbes, Mary Astell, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Thomas Paine, and Mary Wollstonecraft. We will additionally discuss readings in modern criticism and theory to help us better situate our primary texts in the discourses of modernity and better understand their lasting resonances.|Tristan Schweiger|TBA|Consent and Coercion: Rights, Agency, and Authority in the Eighteenth Century and Beyond|1|[42899]|[]|SEM

MAPS32800|Graduate|Open|Fri : 09:30 AM-12:20 PM|This course provides students with an introduction to the phenomenological approach in cultural psychiatry, focusing on the problem of “how to represent mental illness” as a thematic anchor. Students will examine the theoretical and methodological groundings of cultural psychiatry, examining how scholars working in the phenomenological tradition have tried to describe the lived experiences of various forms of “psychopathology” or “madness.” By the end of the course, students will have learned how to describe and analyze the social dimension of a mental health experience, using a phenomenologically-grounded anthropological approach, and by adopting a technical vocabulary for understanding the lived experiences of mental illness (for instance, phenomena, life-world, being-in-the-world, intentionality, epoché, embodiment, madness, psychopathology, melancholia/depression, schizophrenia, etc). In addition, given the ongoing problematic of “how to represent mental illness,” students will also have the opportunity to think through the different ways of presenting their analysis, both in the form of weekly blog entries and during a final-week mock-workshop, where they will showcase their work in a creative medium appropriate to that analysis.|Francis McKay|Saieh Hall for Economics 247|Experiencing Madness: Empathic Methods in Cultural Psychiatry|1|[53673]|[]|SEM

In order to assign a quality grade, an agreement between the sponsoring IME faculty member and each student will be made that includes: (1) the content and scope of the project, (2) expectations for time commitment, (3) a well-defined work plan with timelines for particular experiments or calculations to be accomplished (in a true research experience of the sort we intend to offer, of course, timelines for results can’t be constructed in advance), and (4) a summary of academic goals—such as demonstrating knowledge of the literature and developing communication skills (e.g., though presentations at group meetings). eering Back to top Introduction The Curriculum Programs of Study Anthropology Art History Astronomy and Astrophysics Biological Chemistry Biological Sciences Chemistry Cinema and Media Studies Civilization Studies Classical Studies Comparative Human Development Comparative Literature Comparative Race and Ethnic Studies Computational and Applied Mathematics Computational Neuroscience Computer Science Creative Writing East Asian Languages and Civilizations Economics English Language and Literature Environmental Science Environmental Studies Fundamentals: Issues and Texts Gender and Sexuality Studies Geographical Studies Geophysical Sciences Germanic Studies Global Studies History History, Philosophy, and Social Studies of Science and Medicine Humanities Human Rights Interdisciplinary Studies in the Humanities International Studies Jewish Studies Latin American Studies Law, Letters, and Society Linguistics Mathematics Medieval Studies Molecular Engineering Music Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations New Collegiate Division Philosophy Physical Sciences Physics Political Science Psychology Public Policy Studies Religious Studies Romance Languages and Literatures Russian and East European Studies Social Sciences Sociology South Asian Languages and Civilizations Statistics Theater and Performance Studies Tutorial Studies Visual Arts Academic Regulations and Procedures Examination Credit Transfer Credit Interdisciplinary Opportunities Joint Degree Programs Study Abroad Preparation for Professional Study Scholarly Advancement Archived Catalogs Print Options Search Catalog Search Home > The College Catalog 2016-2017 > Programs of Study > Molecular Engineering Contacts | Institute for Molecular Engineering | Major Program in Molecular Engineering | Minor Program in Molecular Engineering | Grading | Honors | Courses Department Website: http://ime.uchicago.edu/students/undergraduates Engineering is the science of solving complex technological problems and, in the case of molecular engineering, using tools and concepts that arise from the fundamentals of science at the nanoscale. The tools of engineering are important in making and translating basic discoveries in other fields into new intellectual opportunities and, sometimes, useful technologies. Institute for Molecular Engineering The Institute for Molecular Engineering (IME) is founded on the principle of collaborative problem-solving, not rigid academic disciplines. It is at the forefront of an emerging field that has the potential to address fundamental problems of societal import. This exciting new field involves the incorporation of synthetic molecular building blocks into functional systems that will impact technologies from advanced medical therapies to quantum computing. Created in partnership with Argonne National Laboratory, the IME builds on the tradition of collaboration and cutting-edge research well established at Argonne and the University of Chicago. It conducts research at the intersection of chemical, electrical, mechanical, and biological engineering, as well as materials, biological, and physical sciences. The institute’s exploration of innovative technologies in nanoscale manipulation and design at a molecular scale has the potential for impact in such areas as energy, health care, and the environment. Major Program in Molecular Engineering The BS degree program in Molecular Engineering offers undergraduates a cutting-edge engineering curriculum built on a strong foundation in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology. Courses are designed to develop quantitative reasoning and problem-solving skills; to introduce engineering analysis of physical, chemical, and biological systems; and to address open-ended technological questions across a spectrum of disciplines. The program will both prepare undergraduates for a wide variety of careers in technology-focused industries and position graduates for further postgraduate study in such fields as science, engineering, medicine, business, or law. The aim is to introduce invention and design, along with inquiry and discovery, as fruitful and complementary intellectual activities. Majors are able to choose from two quantitative engineering analysis tracks, one aimed at engineering with a biological, chemical, and soft materials emphasis, and one geared toward applied physics. The applied physics track, offered in close collaboration with the Department of Physics, is one of the first initiatives worldwide to formally educate quantum engineers at the undergraduate level. MENG 29500 Engineering Design is a 300-unit design course offered as a capstone, in which student teams spend an intensive quarter working with a faculty mentor to solve an open-ended problem, for example, analyzing chemical and biological properties of cancer cells to develop new treatment and delivery vehicles or harnessing the properties of electrons in materials to develop quantum information technologies. The course also combines technical skills with an exploration of economics, regulatory and legal issues, and ethics. Major Program Requirements 1. A strong and broad background in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology. It is imperative for a modern engineer to have a strong and broad background in the sciences. Traditional engineering disciplines have had requirements in math, chemistry, and physics for decades and many programs have evolved to require biology as well. The highly interdisciplinary nature of Molecular Engineering requires a foundation built across the mathematical, physical, and biological sciences. Students are encouraged to complete their general education requirements at the highest level for which they are prepared. This will position them better to take advantage of advanced electives and research opportunities. As discussed in more detail below, there will be two tracks for Molecular Engineering majors, one aimed towards engineering with a biological, chemical, and soft materials emphasis, and one aimed towards applied physics. Students in the former track will follow precedent set by Chemistry and Biological Sciences majors in that they will likely take chemistry in year 1, physics in year 2, and follow the recommended mathematics courses in the Chemistry curriculum. Students in the latter track will follow precedent set by Physics majors in that they will likely take physics in year 1, follow the mathematics guidelines of Physics majors, and take chemistry in year 2. 2. MENG 26030 Introduction to Engineering Analysis. One of the first courses for all Molecular Engineering majors, this course teaches students to apply mathematical methods towards solving problems that cut across multiple engineering sub-disciplines. A major objective of the course is to teach simple programming skills and computational methods in applied mathematics, including the use of engineering software such as Matlab, Mathematica, Comsol, and elements of Python. The skills that are introduced here will be further developed and strengthened throughout the rest of the curriculum. 3. Two quantitative engineering analysis tracks: Biological, Chemical, and Soft Materials Engineering and Quantum Engineering. Reflecting the research and education themes of the IME, two highly intertwined but recognizably different tracks for the major are available to students. One is aimed at preparing students oriented towards biological, chemical, and soft materials engineering, and the other is aimed at preparing students oriented towards engineering of quantum-based materials, devices, and processes. The latter track is offered in close collaboration with the Department of Physics. The main difference in the tracks relates to a choice between two sequences of three courses under the heading of quantitative engineering analysis. 4. MENG 29500 Engineering Design (300-unit capstone course). This “immersion” design course teaches students how to bring combinations of fundamental science and engineering together to solve open-ended and challenging engineering problems. It also serves as a vehicle to teach other equally important non-technical skills, including: • Problem identification: technology analysis, competitive analysis, market analysis, stakeholder analysis, product definition • Impact of the project, including sociological and engineering ethics • Project planning • Project economics: costs, value/investment analysis, risk analysis and adjustment • Prototyping, experimental design, data analysis, error analysis • IP: patenting, prior art, patentability • Legal and regulatory analysis • Proposing, presenting and reporting • Teamwork IME faculty and fellows will propose open-ended projects for which they will serve as mentors. Students will work together in groups of three. 5. Materials and advanced electives (3 required courses in the major). The major is offered in such a way as to allow for considerable flexibility for students to tailor their programs along individualized trajectories, with help from faculty advisors. Not only can students choose between two tracks, but they can further build breadth or depth through their choice of a materials course and advanced electives. Moreover, we anticipate that our students will use their general electives outside of the major requirements to strengthen their backgrounds in specific areas of interest, also in consultation with Molecular Engineering advisors, to achieve desired outcomes such as preparation for graduate school in more traditional engineering disciplines. 6. Laboratory skills and hands-on experience. Critical skills that molecular engineers must acquire as part of their educational program include the ability to apply knowledge of mathematics, science, and engineering and the ability to design and conduct experiments, as well as the ability to analyze and interpret data. Molecular Engineering majors develop these skills through lab components associated with required courses in the physical and biological sciences, Molecular Engineering courses including MENG 26101-26102 Transport Phenomena I: Forces + Flows; Transport Phenomena II, MENG 26201-26202 Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics I-II, MENG 29500 Engineering Design, and some of the advanced electives such as MENG 27300 Polymer Physics and Engineering. We also anticipate that many Molecular Engineering students will receive advanced laboratory experience pursuing undergraduate research projects. 7. Non-technical skills. Many decades of workshops and panels engaging stakeholders in academia and industry, often associated with the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET), have identified criteria for outcomes of students in accredited engineering education programs. Although there is no thought of seeking ABET accreditation for the Molecular Engineering major, many ABET criteria, particularly those related to non-technological skills, are viewed as essential to incorporate into the Molecular Engineering major. Examples of student outcomes that fall into this category include: (a) an ability to formulate or design a system, process, or program to meet desired needs, (b) an ability to function on multidisciplinary teams, (c) an understanding of professional and ethical responsibility, (d) an ability to communicate effectively, (e) the broad education necessary to understand the impact of solutions in a global and societal context, (f) a recognition of the need for and an ability to engage in life-long learning, and (g) a knowledge of contemporary issues. Many of these outcomes will be addressed through both the Molecular Engineering degree curriculum (emphasized in the design sequence and the research colloquium) and the College general education requirements. Students who are able to both develop and articulate these skills will be positioned favorably for employment in industry and for postgraduate study (engineering, medicine, law, and business administration). Entering the Program Students must indicate their intent to pursue the BS program at the end of the Autumn Quarter in their second year of study by completing the Intent to Pursue Molecular Engineering questionnaire (available on the IME website). They begin the engineering curriculum in the following Spring Quarter with enrollment in either MENG 26010 Engineering Principles of Conservation or MENG 26020 Engineering Electrodynamics.

The overall objective of the program is to provide basic engineering tools and ways of thinking to students that augment scientific approaches and problem solving skills. Minor Program Requirements Before a student can declare the minor in molecular engineering, the student must: Complete the general education requirements in mathematics and physical or biological sciences Earn a B or higher in MENG 20000 Introduction to Emerging Technologies Following completion of the general education requirements and MENG 20000 Introduction to Emerging Technologies (with a grade of B or better), students may apply to the director of undergraduate studies of the Institute for Molecular Engineering for admission into the minor in molecular engineering program. A student must receive the director of undergraduate studies’ approval of the minor program on a form obtained from the student's College adviser. Once signed by the director, this form must then be returned to the student's College adviser by the end of Spring Quarter of the student's third year. To earn the minor in molecular engineering, a student must complete five molecular engineering courses chosen in consultation with the director of undergraduate studies. Before meeting with the director, students should invest some thought into which courses they would like to complete for the minor and how those courses relate as a set. MENG 20000 Introduction to Emerging Technologies and MENG 29700 Undergraduate Research for Molecular Engineering must be among the five courses counted toward the minor. In rare cases, courses offered by other departments and programs may be approved by the director of undergraduate studies as substitutes for courses listed above. Courses in the minor program may not be (1) double counted with the student's major(s) or with other minors, or (2) counted toward general education requirements. Courses in the minor must be taken for quality grades, and more than half of the requirements for the minor must be met by registering for courses bearing University of Chicago course numbers.

Students majoring in Molecular Engineering must receive quality grades in all courses required in the degree program. All courses in the minor must be taken for quality grades. Nonmajors and nonminors may take Molecular Engineering courses on a P/F basis; only grades of C- or higher constitute passing work. Honors Students who pursue a substantive research project with a faculty member of the Institute for Molecular Engineering are encouraged to write and defend an honors thesis based on their work. Students who wish to be considered for honors are expected to complete their arrangements with the director of undergraduate studies before the end of their third year and to register for one quarter of MENG 29700 Undergraduate Research for Molecular Engineering during their third or fourth years. To be eligible to receive honors, students in the BS degree program must write a creditable honors paper describing their research. The paper must be submitted before the deadline established by the director of undergraduate studies and must be approved by the department chairperson. In addition, an oral presentation of the research is required. The research paper or project used to meet this requirement may not be used to meet the BA/BS paper or project requirement in another major. To earn a BS degree with honors in Molecular Engineering, students must also have an overall GPA of 3.0 or higher. Molecular Engineering Courses MENG 20000.

Disease is a major factor in evolution; individuals who are relatively resistant to disease are the ones who survive and reproduce, and who transmit their genes to the next generation. Throughout most of human history, nutritional deficiencies and infectious diseases were probably the major cause of infant and childhood mortality and thus were important factors in natural selection in humans. Culture has greatly altered the human environment, providing us with new but sometimes toxic foods, exposing us to new infectious diseases, and creating other conditions for which our evolutionary heritage has poorly prepared us. We will examine the evolutionary principles and genetic mechanisms that inform our understanding of disease and will discuss the interplay between biological and cultural factors in the etiology of disease.|Robert Perlman|Arranged ARR|Natsci-1: Darwinian Medicine|1|[40719]|[]|SEM

Concepts covered include entity sets and relationships, entity key as a unique identifier for each object in an entity set, one-one, many-one, and many-many relationships as well as translational rules from conceptual modeling (ERD) to relational table definitions. We also examine the relational model and functional dependencies and their application to the methods for improving database design: normal forms and normalization. After design and modeling, students will learn the universal language of relational databases: SQL (Structured Query Language). We start by introducing relational algebra -- the theoretical foundation of SQL. Then we examine in detail the two aspects of SQL: data definition language (DDL) and the data manipulation language (DML).

MSCA32005|Graduate|Open|Fri : 06:00 PM-09:00 PM|One of the most actively developing areas of analytics is the real time analytics because of the growing number of data sources capable of collecting data round the clock in ever-larger amounts and with more complex structure; penetration of smart sensors everywhere where data collection used to be not possible, from micro to macro world and into hostile environments unsuitable for human observers; increasing demand for decisions made at latencies below human reaction time. Conducting real time analysis is different from the traditional data analysis in batch mode. Streaming data makes the very concept of sample nonexistent. Usual static sample characteristics, like p-value turn into dynamically changing processes. The old statistical concept of sufficient statistics may be getting a whole new meaning in the context of streaming data. The focus of the course is on stochastic methods suitable for real time analysis and their statistical implementations. Students will work with real data streaming live from the course server.

MUSI22517|Undergraduate|Open|Tue Thu : 03:00 PM-04:20 PM|The canon—a roster of composers, pieces, or artists elevated to the status of timeless classics—often serves as an invisible backdrop to musical life. But how do hierarchies of value form in the first place? This course explores how canons crystallized in nineteenth-century Europe (with topics such as monumentality, art-religion, and highbrow/lowbrow) and how this history has left traces in arts culture today (such as debates over Venezuela’s El Sistema, culture wars, and the “great books” that have shaped the UChicago Core). While canons have been the subject of heated debate in the humanities, the central aim of this course is not polemical but cultural-historical: to understand how values take root, by whom (and for whom) they are cultivated, and the ideas or actions that give them such extraordinary staying-power.|Abigail Fine|Goodspeed Hall 205|Beethoven or Bust:  Musical Canon-Building in 19th Century Culture|1|[53259]|[]|LEC

While the genre is one often denigrated as staging lyrical utopias of Romance and adventure allowing audiences to escape depressing quotidian realities, many musicals did seek to engage some of the most pressing social issues of their day. In this course, we will look—and listen—closely to four differing musicals from the 20th century, studying their creative origins, while also analyzing their complex social meanings revealed through the story, music, lyrics, staging, and dance. Musicals to be covered: Show Boat (1927), Oklahoma! (1943), My Fair Lady (1953), and Company (1970).

MUSI31400|Graduate|Open|Mon : 09:30 AM-12:20 PM|This proseminar provides both an active, hands-on workshop in musical analysis as well as an opportunity reflect on the nature of academic musical analysis and its place in the disciplinary landscape of 2017. Readings drawn from the current theoretical literature will introduce students to a range of analytical methods, most of which fall outside the purview of the “canonical” graduate music analysis classes in the music curriculum (i.e., Music 31100–31300). In our weekly analytical work we will seek a balance between comparative breadth—drawing on multiple analytical methods—and mastery of specific analytical techniques. Our aim will be to embrace plural methodologies while at the same time honing our critical and evaluative capacities; indeed, we will be especially interested in exploring the status of analytical validity and “criteria of correctness” (Dunsby) in a pluralistic methodological field. Another central theme will be the “multimedia” of academic music analysis: the interaction of sound, text, image, and performance in the effective communication of analytical insight. Repertories addressed will include early music, non-Western repertories (centering especially on the recent work of Tenzer, Roeder, et al), and popular music, in addition to more familiar common-practice fare. Coursework will involve weekly analytical assignments, presentations, and a final paper.|Steven Rings|Regenstein Library 264|Proseminar in Music Analysis|1|[53265]|[]|SEM

NEHC20155|Undergraduate|Open|Tue Thu : 10:30 AM-11:50 AM|Generally speaking, the ancient kingdom of Great Armenia is a marginal entity within the fields of ancient history and archaeology, which attracted relatively few historians of antiquity. As a matter of fact, scholars of Antiquity usually refer to Armenia only when it was involved into one of the frequent military crises between East and West. The country had an important strategic position, a vast expanse of territory, and wealthy natural resources. This explains very well the efforts of the Seleucids and of Rome, and of the Iranian dynasties of the Parthians and the Sassanids, to establish a military control and cultural influence over Armenia. Both contacts with the West and the East shaped the complex identity of Armenia - a somewhat mixed identity which is rather difficult to study. Therefore, both Classical and Iranian scholars tend to neglect the role of Armenia, or to diminish its position in the balance of power: the anachronistic cliché of a Greater Armenia as a «buffer state» is still mentioned. Accordingly, the few specialists on pre-Christian Armenia hardly communicate with those other scholars. Therefore, the very marginality of the kingdom of Armenia has not stimulated neither Classical scholars, nor Iranian scholars, to show interest in Armenia as well. This course will present a comprehensive history of ancient Armenia, from its origins to the fall of the kingdom in 428 CE, in order to reconstruct the history of the Artaxiad and of the Arsacid dynasties within a geopolitical frame considering the role of Armenia between Rome and Iran.”|Giusto Traina|TBA|A Political History of the Ancient Kingdom of Greater Armenia (ca. 188 BCE – 428 CE)|1|[43169]|[]|SEM

In this course, we tackle these questions through an investigation of some the major scandals of the early modern and modern periods in both Europe and the Middle East. From courtroom dramas in Paris and London to fierce debates in coffee houses and newspapers in Cairo, Beirut, and Istanbul, this course offers a comparative view of how scandals were disseminated, received, and narrativized across time and space. In doing so, we will also examine the central role of the ""public"" both as a concept and as an actor in early modern and modern scandals.

NEHC20573|Undergraduate|Open|Mon Wed : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM|How and why do national identities provoke the deep emotional attachments that they do? In this course we try to understand these emotional attachments by examining the narrative of loss and redemption through which most nations in the Balkans retell their Ottoman past. We begin by considering the mythic temporality of the Romantic national narrative while focusing on specific national literary texts where the national past is retold through the formula of original wholeness, foreign invasion, Passion, and Salvation. We then proceed to unpack the structural role of the different elements of that narrative. With the help of Žižek’s theory of the subject as constituted by trauma, we think about the national fixation on the trauma of loss, and the role of trauma in the formation of national consciousness. Specific theme inquiries involve the figure of the Janissary as self and other, brotherhood and fratricide, and the writing of the national trauma on the individual physical body. Special attention is given to the general aesthetic of victimhood, the casting of the victimized national self as the object of the “other’s perverse desire.” With the help of Freud, Žižek, and Kant we consider the transformation of national victimhood into the sublimity of the national self. The main primary texts include Petar Njegoš’ Mountain Wreath (Serbia and Montenegro), Ismail Kadare’s The Castle (Albania), Anton Donchev’s Time of Parting (Bulgaria).|Angelina Ilieva|Foster Hall 408|The Burden of History: The Nation and Its Lost Paradise|1|[42378]|[]|LEC

NEHC20647|Undergraduate|Open|Tue Thu : 10:30 AM-11:50 AM|This course examines the trajectory of Islamic political thought from the nineteenth century to the present day. Through a close study of key texts in this tradition, we will investigate how Islam has remained a vital source of principles and doctrines for a diverse array of political thinkers and movements over the course of the past two centuries. Developments in Islamic thought will be considered in the context of global trends, from the rise of liberalism, nationalism, and socialism to the liberation movements of the twentieth century and the confusion sewn by humanitarian crises of an unprecedented scale. Amidst these dramatic shifts in the geopolitical landscape, how have Muslim thinkers sought to ground their demands for dignity, autonomy, justice, and recognition? What do such claims have to do with the pursuit of personal and collective piety, on the one hand, and spiritual transcendence, on the other? Rather than framing Muslim political thinkers as reacting to global modernity, we understand them as key actors in shaping it, and our study of their writings will be oriented toward achieving a better understanding of the modern era as a whole. Our primary readings will take us from Istanbul, London, and the Nile Delta to Chicago, Tehran, and beyond, while our secondary texts will offer historical background and theoretical and theological context for the thinkers we focus on. The course aims to equip students to explore the Islamic tradition of political thought on their own. All required readings will be made available in English; the ability to read texts in their original languages of authorship (Arabic, Persian, Turkish, Urdu, French, etc.) is useful but not necessary. Some familiarity with the history of the modern Middle East and modern political thought is certainly helpful, but is not required.|Madeleine Elfenbein|TBA|Islamic Political Thought in the Global Era|1|[43157]|[]|LEC

While different in many respects, such as physical size, geographic location, dominant religion and demographic composition, these states also share important similarities that distinguish them from the rest of the predominantly Arab Middle East region. Both Israel and Turkey have historically embraced a strong orientation towards the West in their national ethos and security ties, and have complicated relationships with their immediate Arab and Muslim neighbors. Both exercise democratic practices at the procedural level but have recently been experiencing a serious erosion of substantive aspects of democracy, particularly with regards to the protection of freedoms and rights and the erosion of democratic institutions. Both are composed of prevailing ethnoreligious groups and religious and ethnic minorities that challenge the dominant structure from within and at their borders.

The broad historical periodization will cover late Ottoman Syria, French colonial rule following World War I, the years of instability following Syrian independence, and “stability” under the Assad household. This course will also discuss the rise of Syrian national and broader pan-Arab consciousness, Islamic revivalism, and armed revolt. Concurrent with our survey of Syrian history, this course will also progress chronologically through the Syrian conflict and leverage the history learned along the way as a lens through which we contextualize and analyze the ongoing crisis. No prior knowledge of the Middle East is required and this course is open to both undergraduate and graduate students. Additional Notes: This course is a mix of lectures and regular student participation. Students will be asked to select a particular aspect of Syrian history (e.g. the Kurdish community, refugees, militant activity, etc.) that they are interested in researching and presenting brief updates on throughout the course.

This course explores the emergence of the 'Middle East' as an object of inquiry; a place with a people and a culture set in opposition to the 'West'. It asks how these categories are constituted, by whom, and with what consequence. How do they define the contours of political community, the possibilities for empathy and understanding or the limits of rights and moral obligation? The historical and contemporary texts assigned draw attention to the layered and shifting meanings of these categories, and in turn to the geopolitical and epistomological worlds that give rise to them. By putting these texts into conversation with each other the course engages a number of key issues that have occupied social theorists: the relationship between power and knowledge, the politics of representation, and the nature of social theory more generally.|Yaqub Hilal|TBA|Rethinking the Middle East|1|[43388]|[]|SEM

PBPL28805|Undergraduate|Open|Tue Thu : 12:00 PM-01:20 PM|The standard theory of rational choice exhibits explanatory power in a vast range of circumstances, including such disparate decision making environments as whether to commit a crime, have children, or seek to emigrate. Nonetheless, shortfalls from full rationality seem not to be uncommon, and are themselves, to some extent, systematic. Behavioral economics documents and tries to account for these departures from full rationality. This course looks at areas in which some modification of the traditional rational choice apparatus might most be warranted; these include decisions that unfold over time, involve low probability events, or implicate willpower. To what extent should public policy respond to shortfalls from rationality or concern itself with promoting happiness?|James A Leitzel|TBA|Behavioral Economics and Policy|1|[42235]|[]|DIS
PBPL28820|Undergraduate|Open|Thu : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|The goal of this course is to make students better producers and consumers of machine learning tools designed to help solve public policy problems. One thing this goal requires is some understanding of the basics of machine learning: how it works, what makes it different from the usual sort of statistical and econometric tools that we tend to use in social science studies of public policy problems, and how to implement these prediction models (which we will be doing in R, a free statistical program that now includes many machine learning packages). But this goal also requires some understanding of issues that are outside the usual machine learning toolkit, such as: what sorts of public policy problems are right for these tools, and which are not; how do we know whether a new prediction tool is capable of actually improving policy decisions, not just predicting outcomes accurately within some hold-out set; what additional considerations around fairness and other normative values may arise in using machine learning tools for public policy applications; and what challenges are associated with getting policymakers, front-line practitioners or individual citizens to make use of prediction tools and resulting decision aids.|Jens Ludwig|TBA|Machine Learning and Policy|1|[42236]|[]|LEC

PHIL21506|Undergraduate|Open|Mon : 03:00 PM-05:50 PM|In one of his most widely read pieces of writing—the chapter of his Essay Concerning Human Understanding called “Of Identity and Diversity”—John Locke writes: “[S]ince consciousness always accompanies thinking, and ‘tis that, that makes every one to be, what he calls self; and thereby distinguishes himself from all other thinking things, in this alone consists personal Identity, i.e. the sameness of rational Being: And as far as this consciousness can be extended backwards to any past Action or Thought, so far reaches the Identity of that Person…” Locke’s theory of personal identity has puzzled, annoyed, and inspired readers since it was published in the second edition of his Essay, in 1694. The main aim of this course will be to arrive at a reading of it that (1) situates it in the context of earlier philosophers’ writings about selves, memory, and consciousness, (2) is informed by an understanding of Locke’s own views concerning substance, consciousness, and memory, among other things, (3) carefully considers objections that later writers—most famously Butler and Reid—made to Locke’s theory. In this endeavor, we’ll be aided by two excellent recent books: Udo Theil’s The Early Modern Subject (2011) and Matthew Stuart’s Locke’s Metaphysics (2013).

PHIL23307|Undergraduate|Open|Tue Thu : 12:00 PM-01:20 PM|Play is a pervasive, and often underappreciated, feature of the lives of humans and many other animal species. It's also a lot of fun. In this course, we will consider the nature and significance of play, with a particular focus on the distinctively human form of play called games. The course will focus on three interrelated themes. (1) What are play and games? Drawing on thinkers like Johan Huizinga, Roger Caillois, and Bernard Suits, we will develop a vocabulary that allows us to tackle this question analytically, and to draw salient distinctions between kinds of play and games. We will also ask why humans and other animals play, and what form the answer to that question should take. (2) What is the value of playing? Sen and Nussbaum classify play as one of the basic human capabilities. Suits argues that playing games is central to the ideal human life. In investigating the significance of play to human life, we will also consider the ethics and aesthetics of playing. (3) How can thinking about play cast light on other human activities? Wittgenstein famously talks about linguistic activity in terms of games. Rawls uses games to think more generally about rule-governed institutions. And Huizinga argues that both artistic and religious activities are structurally indistinguishable from play. Could play be even more central to human experience than we suppose?|David Egan|TBA|The Philosophy of Play and Games|1|[53463]|[]|SEM
PHIL24301|Undergraduate|Open|Tue : 12:00 PM-02:50 PM|One can distinguish four ways in which science and aesthetics are related during the period since the Renaissance. First, science has been the subject of artistic representation, in painting and photography, in poetry and novels (e.g., in Byron’s poetry, for example). Second, science has been used to explain aesthetic effects (e.g., Helmholtz’s work on the way painters achieve visual effects or musicians achieve tonal effects). Third, aesthetic means have been used to convey scientific conceptions (e.g., through illustrations in scientific volumes or through aesthetically affective and effective writing).

PHIL27000|Undergraduate|Open|Tue Thu : 10:30 AM-11:50 AM|The philosophical ideas and methods of Immanuel Kant’s “critical” philosophy set off a revolution that reverberated through 19th-century philosophy. We will trace the effects of this revolution and the responses to it, focusing in particular on the changing conception of what philosophical ethics might hope to achieve. We will begin with a consideration of Kant’s famous Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals, in which the project of grounding all ethical obligations in the very idea of rational freedom is announced. We will then consider Hegel’s radicalization of this project in his Philosophy of Right, which seeks to derive from the idea of rational freedom, not just formal constraints on right action, but a determinate, positive conception of what Hegel calls “ethical life”. We will conclude with an examination of three great critics of the Kantian/Hegelian project in ethical theory: Karl Marx, Søren Kierkegaard, and Friedrich Nietzsche.|Matthew Boyle|5727 S.

PHIL34301|Graduate|Open|Tue : 12:00 PM-02:50 PM|One can distinguish four ways in which science and aesthetics are related during the period since the Renaissance. First, science has been the subject of artistic representation, in painting and photography, in poetry and novels (e.g., in Byron’s poetry, for example). Second, science has been used to explain aesthetic effects (e.g., Helmholtz’s work on the way painters achieve visual effects or musicians achieve tonal effects). Third, aesthetic means have been used to convey scientific conceptions (e.g., through illustrations in scientific volumes or through aesthetically affective and effective writing). Finally, philosophers have stepped back to consider the relationship between scientific knowing and aesthetic comprehension (e.g., Kant, Bas van Fraassen); much of the discussion of this latter will focus on the relation between images and what they represent.

PHIL55800|Graduate|Open|Fri : 09:30 AM-12:20 PM|Aristotle’s investigation into the nature of primary being (or substance, ousia) in the middle books of his Metaphysics proceeds against the backdrop of two structural commitments: (i) categorialism; and (ii) the modalities of being, namely actuality and potentiality. Metaphysics Θ is given over in large measure to (ii), though it proceeds alert to the role of (i) as well. We will proceed in two phases. In the first phase, we will work minutely through every chapter save the last of Metaphysics Θ, attending closely to the text—elucidating, interpreting, and assessing. In the second phase, we will work through the same text again, now thematically, primarily with a view to understanding four interconnected issues: the natures of potentiality and actuality; the priority of actuality; the role of the modalities in the science of being qua being; and the broader relation between the modalities and categorialism. Naturally these sorts of questions will be in view in our first pass through the text, but we will largely hold them in abeyance until the second pass, we will also make freer use of the entire Aristotelian corpus in our discussions. No knowledge of Greek is required, though I will gladly arrange an informal reading group associated with the seminar for those participants interested in working through key passages in the original.

PHSC12720|Undergraduate|Open|Mon Wed Fri : 10:30 AM-11:20 AM|The past two decades have witnessed the discovery of planets in orbit around other stars and the characterization of extra-Solar (exo-) planetary systems. We are now able to place our Solar System into the context of other worlds and a surprising conclusion that most planetary systems look nothing like our own. A challenging next step is to find planets as small as the Earth in orbit around stars like the Sun. The architecture of planetary systems reflects the formation of the parent star and its protoplanetary disk, and how these have changed with time.

The aim of the course is not only to give students a close familiarity with our two authors and some of the scholarship surrounding them, but also, more broadly, to think through the relationship between political theory and history. How might political theory guide the writing of history, and how can history contribute to theorizing politics?

But what do these concepts really mean—and how much of a difference do they really make? We'll begin by considering the ways in which fears of tyrannical, arbitrary, unaccountable rule have long been central to democratic political thought and practice. But we'll spend most of our time on contemporary issues and problems. How should we conceive of accountability, both conceptually and normatively? Are elections sufficient to make politicians accountable to ordinary citizens? What forms of accountability are appropriate for modern democratic politics? Is accountability only for elites, or should ordinary citizens be accountable to one another? In what contexts are transparency and accountability valuable, and when might we instead find their operation counter-productive and troubling?

In Latin America, however, even as almost all nations have democratized and economies have grown, clientelism continues to play an important role in mobilizing voters.

PLSC27704|Undergraduate|Open|Wed Fri : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM|The labelling as ‘democracy’ our own preferred mode of self-government reflects a choice to adopt the ancient Greeks as our political ancestors. At the end of the twentieth century, the predominant view was that democracy had triumphed over fascism and communism and was secure in its standing as the sole legitimate mode of modern politics. Political theorists skeptical of this view argued that what had triumphed was not properly ‘democracy’ at all, often because political practice in modern democracies failed to measure up to a classical ideal. We will investigate uses of the ancient Greek past by modern critics of the theory and practice of liberal democratic politics. With a focus on post-war theorists like Hannah Arendt, Bernard Williams, and Pierre Hadot, we will ask how recovering aspects of the classical tradition might revitalize the modern theoretical and practical political landscape. By elucidating the political motivations behind, and implications of, the use of the ancient Greeks by these and other thinkers, we will clarify post-war critiques of the theory and practice of modern democratic politics that continue to influence theorists today.|Jared Holley|TBA|Democracy, Ancient and Modern|1|[41782]|[]|SEM
PLSC28310|Undergraduate|Open|Tue : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|As the struggle over slavery came to a head in the decades preceding the Civil War, debates opposed not just defenders of slavery to abolitionists but also abolitionists to each other. Reformers confronted weighty questions such as the political strategy most likely to bring about emancipation, the broader commitments on which arguments for abolition should be grounded, the attitude to adopt vis-à-vis oppressive state institutions, and the intersections between the fight for legal freedom and other rights and other movements. In this course, we will explore the political stakes and theoretical underpinnings of these debates. We will do so primarily through close readings of writings, speeches, essays, pamphlets, and short stories written by various antebellum actors and thinkers such as Frederick Douglass, George Fitzhugh, Frances Harper, Harriet Jacobs, Angelina Grimké, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, Herman Melville, Wendell Phillips, Lysander Spooner, Henry David Thoreau, and David Walker. Topics will include the language of natural right, one’s obligations toward government and human law, the emergence of capitalism, the justifiability of violence, gender in the antislavery struggle, and the Constitution’s relation to social change.|Daniel Nichanian|TBA|American Antislavery: Antebellum Political Thought and Political Strategy|1|[41783]|[]|SEM
PLSC28710|Undergraduate|Open|Mon Wed : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM|How do political institutions affect the redistribution of wealth among members of a society? In most democracies, the distribution of wealth among citizens is unequal but the right to vote is universal. Why then have so many newly democratic states transitioned under conditions of high inequality yet failed to redistribute? This course explores this puzzle by analyzing the mechanisms through which individual and group preferences can be translated into pro-poor policies, and the role elites play in influencing a government's capacity or incentives to redistribute wealth. Topics include economic inequality and the demand for redistribution, the difference in redistribution between democracy and dictatorship, the role of globalization in policymaking, and the effects of redistribution on political stability and change.|Michael Albertus|Pick Hall 506|Democracy and the Politics of Wealth Redistribution|1|[41784]|[]|SEM

We will analyze what governments do “behind closed doors” and learn about different theoretical approaches to understanding the production of secrecy, its effects on participants, and its consequences on issues like conflict and diplomacy. The course covers ten specific domains featuring secrecy, including secret state partnerships, closed-door crisis decision-making, secrecy during war, and the process of gathering and analyzing intelligence. Questions we will address include: What agreements do diplomats negotiate privately and why? For what ends do state use secrecy in wartime? What do covert cooperative partnerships look like and when do they succeed? What espionage practices do states use and how have they changed over time? Students will also gain experience doing their own research about secret statecraft via a research paper case study that showcases their own analysis of declassified materials.

The goals of the course are to teach students the statistical methods needed to pursue independent large-n research projects and to develop the skills necessary to pursue further methods training in the social sciences. Part I of the course reviews the simple linear model (as seen in STAT 22000 or its equivalent) with attention to the theory of statistical inference and the derivation of estimators. Basic calculus and linear algebra will be introduced. Part II extends the linear model to the multivariate case. Emphasis will be placed on model selection and specification. Part III examines the consequences of data that is ""poorly behaved"" and how to cope with the problem. Depending on time, Part IV will introduce special topics like systems of simultaneous equations, logit and probit models, time-series methods, etc. Little prior knowledge of math or statistics is expected, but students are expected to work hard to develop the tools introduced in class.

The course will be organized around an intensive engagement with two central texts: Herodotus’ Histories and Thucydides’ History of the Peloponnesian War. As we read through these works, we will also take up the wider historical and political context—e.g., the fifth-century rise of Athenian democracy and imperialism—and the relationship between our texts and other genres, including philosophy, drama, and rhetoric. The aim of the course is not only to give students a close familiarity with our two authors and some of the scholarship surrounding them, but also, more broadly, to think through the relationship between political theory and history. How might political theory guide the writing of history, and how can history contribute to theorizing politics? What can our reading of Herodotus and Thucydides tell us about how to think about these questions in different eras and contexts?

Through careful study of the meaning and function of Arendt’s often-puzzling distinctions among “public,” “private” and “social” and among “labor,” “work,” and “action,” we’ll try to understand her account of the significance and prospects of human activity, including especially political activity, in modernity. Topics of special concern may include: the relation between philosophy and politics; Arendt's relationship to Marx and to the Marxist critique of capitalism; the meanings of work and leisure in the twentieth century and beyond; the nature and basis of political power and freedom; the relations between art and politics; the significance of city life for politics; and many others. While The Human Condition will be at the center of the course, the book will be supplemented and framed by other material, including essays on related subjects by Arendt; excerpts from some of the other thinkers with whom Arendt was in conversation; and material by later writers that will help us situate Arendt in the larger contexts of twentieth-century intellectual life, and which will also give us different angles on some of the key issues in Arendt’s book.

Originally published in 1943, it is one of Strauss’s most intransigent essays.

There is an intentional absence of thematic unity among the topics. Some units look more closely at recent debates within the classic paradigms (e.g. “the practice turn in constructivist research”) while others are not easily categorized along these lines (e.g. “emotions in IR”). Some focus on work across empirical domains that shares a recently popular methodological innovation (e.g. “the experimental turn in IR”); other topics are located closer towards the fringe of mainstream IR but showcase interesting and creative ways of doing our work (e.g. “spatial thinking in IR”). Specific topics will change with each offering and are chosen based on a combination of importance to the field, value as exemplars of creative and rigorous research, and my own personal interests. Participants will demonstrate fluency in these debates and develop opinions about their significance and staying power. A secondary goal is for students to expand their own research interests and draw lessons about how debates and fads evolve in IR to maximize the impact of their own work.

First, students will replace purely metaphorical (and vague) talk of networks with focused propositions about the network properties and dynamics of contemporary phenomena such as international hierarchy, regional fragmentation amidst global integration, and the fate of sovereign territoriality in an age of (violent) transnational activism. Second, students will ponder competing explanations of the network turn in IPE: have IPE scholars abandoned conventional analytical tools in favor of network theory, because the conventional toolkit already came with rudimentary network-theoretic devices that simply needed sharpening; or did some changes in the real international economy prompt the shift? Finally, students will critically assess the ability of SNT to be a vehicle for innovative social science. They will do this, in part, by devising a research proposal of their own that assesses the validity and utility of testing a single network-theoretic proposition against some conventional competitor.|Matthias Staisch|Saieh Hall for Economics 242|Network Theory for International Political Economy|1|[41846]|[]|SEM

PPHA32720|Graduate|Open|Mon : 03:00 PM-05:50 PM|This course is about imagining the future – and developing a plan to make it happen. We will combine the theoretical and the practical. We will think creatively and philosophically about what could be, and work concretely on how to build it. Government is, everywhere, an industry in serious trouble. Its consumers are disenchanted and looking for alternatives, its products are failing the tests of quality and innovation, and its cost structure is too high. If governments were private firms, they’d be facing the dual prospects of either a takeover to “rescue” them or death in the competitive marketplace as their customer base migrates to newer alternatives. And, in fact, governments today face precisely those challenges. The idea behind this course is to address the government biz as exactly that: a mismanaged industry, business entity, or brand. We will study the history of the modern state and theories of how it will evolve in coming decades. We will consider what this means for the institution of government and what exactly “government” is. And we will look at what this means for the potential of private-sector, non-profit, non-governmental and trans-governmental entities to compete with the nation-state and take over its functions – and the possibilities that government can compete back and perhaps expand its own “business” line. But the course is intended to produce not just deep-thinking and new theories, but also concrete business plans. Students will be expected to identify either a new business idea or product line for a government entity to launch or a current government function that a for-profit or non-profit business can undertake to compete successfully with the public sector – and then develop a detailed business plan.

Individuals aim at choosing the best possible match given their preferences and the costs they face. This course will analyze the social and economic consequences of individuals matching behavior, with an emphasis on inequality, discrimination and segregation. In the marriage market, assortative mating tends to perpetuate human capital inequalities across generations. In the labor market, firms may prefer to hire white males rather than women or minorities. We will explore to what extent this can be explained by pure discrimination and whether affirmative action can lead to better outcomes. Finally, we will examine how residential segregation arises and to what extent desegregation as a public policy can improve the outcomes of disadvantaged groups.|Ioana Marinescu|Public Policy 289A|Matching, Efficiency and Inequality|1|[43527]|[]|SEM
PPHA34600|Graduate|Closed|Mon Wed : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM|This course introduces you to the tools used by social scientists and policymakers to evaluate the impact of government policies. The courses objective is to teach you how to use these tools well enough to feel comfortable evaluating the quality of program evaluations that you are likely to review during your careers. The course begins by examining the elements of a cost/benefit analysis. Some of the principles we discuss during this part of the course are identical to those used by managers in a private firm when they consider whether to invest in new plant or equipment, to train their workers, or to initiate new human resource practices. But it also is important to recognize the differences between cost-benefit analyses of social programs and of private sector investments. Here we examine how the concepts of consumer and producer surplus discussed in your economics courses guide us in formulating evaluation questions and choosing appropriate outcome measures. Most of the course examines the strategies for evaluating the impact that government policies have on alternative outcomes. The key question here is what would have been the outcome had individuals, neighborhoods, state, etc., not been exposed to the policy. The impact of the policy is the difference between the actual outcome and this counterfactual outcome. Much social science research demonstrates that obtaining credible estimates of these impacts can be difficult. During this part of the course, we discuss how to plausibly address some of the more common difficulties encountered by program evaluators.|Jeffrey Grogger|Public Policy 140C|Program Evaluation|1|[43531]|[]|LEC

The policy is said to be fair, to contribute to the common good, to promote our common values, etc. But what does this all mean? Can this appeal to values be in any way rational? By introducing the major families of contemporary theories of justice, this class will allow students to form an informed opinion with respect to what kind of justifications can be supported from the point of view of a theory of justice. We will establish the place of these theories of justice in the history of ideas and compare the different theories with respect to their main concepts. The course will also dwell on the theories’ implications for public policy.

Through years of education and experience we come to understand increasingly complex and accurate theories of how the world works. However, how we come to comprehend the nuances of concepts like gravity or even how a child learns to grasp the concept of seven is still widely disagreed upon. Our exploration will combine theoretical and empirical papers to gain an appreciation for various theories of conceptual development and evaluate their ability to explain observed psychological phenomena.

PSYC23165|Undergraduate|Open|Wed : 09:30 AM-12:20 PM|The past decade saw an explosion of empirical research in the study of morality. Among the most exciting and novel findings and theories, evolutionary biologists and comparative psychologists have shown that moral cognition has evolved to facilitate cooperation and smooth social interactions, and that certain components of morality are present in non-human animals. Developmental psychologists came up with ingenious paradigms, demonstrating that the elements that underpin morality are in place much earlier than we thought, and clearly in place before children turn two. Social neuroscientists have begun to map brain circuits implicated in moral decision-making and identify the contribution of neuropetides to moral sensitivity. Changes in the balance of brain chemistry, or in connectivity between regions can cause changes in moral behavior. The lesson from all this new knowledge is clear: human moral behavior cannot be separated from human biology, its development, and past evolutionary history. As our understanding of the human brain improves, society at large, and justice and the law in particular, are and will be increasingly challenged. Discoveries in neuroscience will soon impact our legal system in ways that hopefully lead to a more cost-effective, humane and flexible system than we have today. The intent of this class is to provide an overview of the current research on the morality, and examine this topic from a range of relevant interdisciplinary perspectives.|Jean Decety|Psychology G117|Multidisciplinary Perspectives on Morality|1|[41236]|[]|SEM

PSYC24050|Undergraduate|Open|Mon : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|"Thinking about the nature of wisdom goes back to the Greek philosophers and the classical religious sages, but the concept of wisdom has changed in many ways over the history of thought. While wisdom has received less scholarly attention in modern times, it has recently re-emerged in popular discourse with a growing recognition of its potential importance for addressing complex issues in many domains. But what is wisdom? It’s often used with a meaning more akin to ""smart"" or ""clever."" Is it just vast knowledge? This course will examine the nature of wisdom—how it has been defined, how its meaning has changed, and what its essential components might be. We will examine how current psychological theories conceptualize wisdom and consider whether, and how, wisdom can be studied scientifically; that is, can wisdom be measured and experimentally manipulated to illuminate its underlying mechanisms and understand its functions? Finally, we will explore how concepts of wisdom can be applied in business, education, medicine, the law, and in the course of our everyday lives.

This erudite Polish author is a prime 20th century modernist whose novels, entangled in an ongoing battle with fundamental questions and, indeed, with existence itself, explode with uncanny laughter. In contrast to many of his contemporary writers who established their reputation by applying existing philosophical models, Gombrowicz employed ironically his philosophical erudition, while engaging in his philosophical récit the literary and cultural tropes which derived from his Polish cultural heritage. Over the next ten weeks, we will investigate how he twisted these references and tropes to inform a distinctly Gombrowiczian version of performative philosophy. We will read Gombrowicz’s novels, lectures on philosophy and some of his autobiographical writings to seek answers to our overarching question: what makes this author a philosopher?|Bozena Shallcross|Foster Hall 408|Gombrowicz: The Writer as Philosopher|1|[42355]|[]|LEC
REES21006|Undergraduate|Open|Mon Wed : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM|Course centers on Joseph Conrad’s The Secret Agent: A Simple Tale. Contemporary critics often consider this novel the archetypal fictional work about terrorism, as it is based on the bomb attack that occurred in Greenwich in 1888. The Secret Agent demonstrates, however, much more than its prophetic significance rediscovered after 9/11. Therefore, the course seeks how the novel’s relevance stems in equal measure from Conrad’s interest in a wider political process and his distrust of state power; in particular, the course explores how these forces determine the individual caught in a confining situation. We read The Secret Agent as a political novel, that struggle for solutions defies chaos as well as an imposition of a single ideology or one authorial point of view. Its ambiguities and political antinomies allow for interdisciplinary readings that also present an opportunity to critically overview the established approaches to main Conradian themes. In analyzing the formation of the narrative’s ideology we discuss Conrad’s historical pessimism that demonstrates with sustained irony how capitalism breeds social injustice that, in turn, breeds anarchism. The class also focuses on how the novel exposes duplicity in staging surveillance, terrorism, as well as adjacent forms of violence or sacrifice. Critical texts include several older but still influential readings (Jameson, Eagleton) and the most recent.|Bozena Shallcross|TBA|Joseph Conrad's The Secret Agent: (In)action, Surveillance, Terrorism|1|[42359]|[]|LEC

Many of the chief theoretical concerns of the Intelligentsia (the role of the public intellectual in society, the expression of dissidence and the ethics of exile) have preoccupied thinkers since Socrates. What distinguishes the Intelligentsia from other models of public intellectualism? How have various Slavic public intellectuals maintained, or broken with, this tradition? In order to establish a theoretical vocabulary, the course will begin with an introduction to several classical and contemporary theories of the role of the intellectual in society. We will then ground our inquiry in the historical invention of the Russian Intelligentsia during the mid-19th Century before setting off to analyze its 20th and 21st-century manifestations. Throughout the course, our main goal will be to examine the ways in which these thinkers conceive of and perform the role of a “public intellectual.” How do they balance the tasks of documenting and participating in the historical events they describe? What strategies do they utilize in order to relay their intellectual activity to a larger public? What do they consider to be the responsibility of intellectuals?|Kaitlyn Tucker|TBA|The Intelligentsia:  On Slavic Social Thought|1|[42372]|[]|LEC

REES29013|Undergraduate|Open|Mon Wed : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM|How and why do national identities provoke the deep emotional attachments that they do? In this course we try to understand these emotional attachments by examining the narrative of loss and redemption through which most nations in the Balkans retell their Ottoman past. We begin by considering the mythic temporality of the Romantic national narrative while focusing on specific national literary texts where the national past is retold through the formula of original wholeness, foreign invasion, Passion, and Salvation. We then proceed to unpack the structural role of the different elements of that narrative. With the help of Žižek’s theory of the subject as constituted by trauma, we think about the national fixation on the trauma of loss, and the role of trauma in the formation of national consciousness. Specific theme inquiries involve the figure of the Janissary as self and other, brotherhood and fratricide, and the writing of the national trauma on the individual physical body. Special attention is given to the general aesthetic of victimhood, the casting of the victimized national self as the object of the “other’s perverse desire.” With the help of Freud, Žižek, and Kant we consider the transformation of national victimhood into the sublimity of the national self. The main primary texts include Petar Njegoš’ Mountain Wreath (Serbia and Montenegro), Ismail Kadare’s The Castle (Albania), Anton Donchev’s Time of Parting (Bulgaria).|Angelina Ilieva|Foster Hall 408|The Burden of History: The Nation and Its Lost Paradise|1|[42373]|[]|LEC

REES31000|Graduate|Open|Tue Thu : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM|In this course, we will dwell on Witold Gombrowicz the philosopher, exploring the components of his authorial style that substantiate his claim to both the literary and the philosophical spheres. This erudite Polish author is a prime 20th century modernist whose novels, entangled in an ongoing battle with fundamental questions and, indeed, with existence itself, explode with uncanny laughter. In contrast to many of his contemporary writers who established their reputation by applying existing philosophical models, Gombrowicz employed ironically his philosophical erudition, while engaging in his philosophical récit the literary and cultural tropes which derived from his Polish cultural heritage. Over the next ten weeks, we will investigate how he twisted these references and tropes to inform a distinctly Gombrowiczian version of performative philosophy. We will read Gombrowicz’s novels, lectures on philosophy and some of his autobiographical writings to seek answers to our overarching question: what makes this author a philosopher?|Bozena Shallcross|Foster Hall 408|Gombrowicz: The Writer as Philosopher|1|[42358]|[]|LEC
REES31006|Graduate|Open|Mon Wed : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM|Course centers on Joseph Conrad’s The Secret Agent: A Simple Tale. Contemporary critics often consider this novel the archetypal fictional work about terrorism, as it is based on the bomb attack that occurred in Greenwich in 1888. The Secret Agent demonstrates, however, much more than its prophetic significance rediscovered after 9/11. Therefore, the course seeks how the novel’s relevance stems in equal measure from Conrad’s interest in a wider political process and his distrust of state power; in particular, the course explores how these forces determine the individual caught in a confining situation. We read The Secret Agent as a political novel, that struggle for solutions defies chaos as well as an imposition of a single ideology or one authorial point of view. Its ambiguities and political antinomies allow for interdisciplinary readings that also present an opportunity to critically overview the established approaches to main Conradian themes. In analyzing the formation of the narrative’s ideology we discuss Conrad’s historical pessimism that demonstrates with sustained irony how capitalism breeds social injustice that, in turn, breeds anarchism. The class also focuses on how the novel exposes duplicity in staging surveillance, terrorism, as well as adjacent forms of violence or sacrifice. Critical texts include several older but still influential readings (Jameson, Eagleton) and the most recent.|Bozena Shallcross|TBA|Joseph Conrad's The Secret Agent: (In)action, Surveillance, Terrorism|1|[42363]|[]|LEC

REES39013|Graduate|Open|Mon Wed : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM|How and why do national identities provoke the deep emotional attachments that they do? In this course we try to understand these emotional attachments by examining the narrative of loss and redemption through which most nations in the Balkans retell their Ottoman past. We begin by considering the mythic temporality of the Romantic national narrative while focusing on specific national literary texts where the national past is retold through the formula of original wholeness, foreign invasion, Passion, and Salvation. We then proceed to unpack the structural role of the different elements of that narrative. With the help of Žižek’s theory of the subject as constituted by trauma, we think about the national fixation on the trauma of loss, and the role of trauma in the formation of national consciousness. Specific theme inquiries involve the figure of the Janissary as self and other, brotherhood and fratricide, and the writing of the national trauma on the individual physical body. Special attention is given to the general aesthetic of victimhood, the casting of the victimized national self as the object of the “other’s perverse desire.” With the help of Freud, Žižek, and Kant we consider the transformation of national victimhood into the sublimity of the national self. The main primary texts include Petar Njegoš’ Mountain Wreath (Serbia and Montenegro), Ismail Kadare’s The Castle (Albania), Anton Donchev’s Time of Parting (Bulgaria).|Angelina Ilieva|Foster Hall 408|The Burden of History: The Nation and Its Lost Paradise|1|[42380]|[]|LEC

RETH46502|Graduate|Open|Tue Thu : 10:30 AM-11:50 AM|Environmental issues have been studied by religious ethicists of many long-established religious traditions as well as emerging nature religions. While common themes often emerge in terms of the ethical ideas used (justice, responsibility) or the subjects studied (species extinction, population, water, food, climate change, etc.), religious ethicists draw on a wide range of ethical methods, theories, and sources of authority to develop their environmental ethics. To illustrate this diversity we will explore several ethical methods as applied to environmental ethics. These approaches may include the use of the Bible, Church teachings, virtue ethics, and natural law theory in Eastern Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and Protestant environmental ethics; how the Islamic legal tradition can be applied to environmental issues; the use of prayer, meditation, and ethical analysis in Buddhist environmental ethics; the ethics of the nature religion of deep ecology; and/or the quest for a global environmental ethic as expressed in the Earth Charter initiative.|Sarah E.

Most of the course will examine how religious and philosophical ethical systems respond to the vast temporal and spatial scales of climate change and its inherent uncertainties. For instance, common principles of environmental ethics such as justice and responsibility are often reimagined in climate ethics. We will also explore the degree to which the assumptions of many modern Western ethical systems including linear causality, an emphasis on individuals, and purely rational decision-making foster or inhibit climate ethics.

Until today the appropriation of Byzantine style is especially evident in the church of Saint Mark the Evangelist, as well as in the decoration of less-well known medieval churches of the Venetian Lagoon. During the so-called Fourth Crusade, the Sack of Constantinople has led to large-scale pillaging of the Byzantine capital and the transfer to Venice of countless Byzantine artifacts, among them are liturgical items, reliquaries, icons, and architectural spoils. How were these artifacts employed in the Venetian Lagoon for religious and political ends after being disassociated from their original contexts? What transformations did they experience with regard to usage and appearance? What kinds of new ceremonies, both religious and secular, did they inspire? What was their impact on artistic creativity and religious life in their new environment? How were they perceived intellectually, and what kinds of narratives evolved around them in Venice over the centuries? These are some of the key questions to guide our research. On a broader scale, we will investigate various phenomena of cultural transfer and ‘hybridity’ from the Middle Ages to the Baroque era.|Karin Krause|Swift Hall 201|Between East and West: Venice in the Pre-Modern Period|1|[41403]|[]|SEM

SIGN26003|Undergraduate|Open|Tue : 12:00 PM-02:50 PM|One can distinguish four ways in which science and aesthetics are related during the period since the Renaissance. First, science has been the subject of artistic representation, in painting and photography, in poetry and novels (e.g., in Byron’s poetry, for example). Second, science has been used to explain aesthetic effects (e.g., Helmholtz’s work on the way painters achieve visual effects or musicians achieve tonal effects). Third, aesthetic means have been used to convey scientific conceptions (e.g., through illustrations in scientific volumes or through aesthetically affective and effective writing). Finally, philosophers have stepped back to consider the relationship between scientific knowing and aesthetic comprehension (e.g., Kant, Bas van Fraassen); much of the discussion of this latter will focus on the relation between images and what they represent.

Social class had great effect on one's social standing; economic well-being; political power; access to knowledge; and even longevity, health, and height. In that time, there was hardly an aspect of life that was not profoundly influenced by social class. In the ensuing period, the effects of social class have receded greatly, and perhaps have even vanished. In their place formal schooling has become the great generalized influence over who gets access to the desiderata of social life, including food, shelter, political power, and medical care. So it is that schooling is sociologically interesting for reasons that go well beyond education.

SOCI20257|Undergraduate|Open|Fri : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|The term “Third World” has become outmoded and politically incorrect. The category has become increasingly differentiated over time, and academic discourse has shifted its focus from difference to integration in the form of “globalization.” If, today, it would appear naïve to use the term indiscriminately, it would be equally naïve to dispense with it altogether. We continue to make the distinction between “first” and “third” worlds (although using different, euphemistic terms) because it marks real differences between domains. In this course, we take up the difference in urban structures and processes. We will consider the “Third World city” a meaningful analytical category—to be distinguished, on the one hand, from the “First World” cities that inform so much of urban sociology, and, on the other, from global cities. We will spend the course discussing how and why these cities are different. In particular, we will talk about their explosive growth in the twentieth century, the precarious nature of urban employment, informal settlement as a major urban form, the housing divide as a social structure distinct to such cities, class formation, the impact of neoliberal reforms, democratization, urban spatial restructuring in the 1990s, and urban politics.

What social variables influence and shape 'real' markets and market activities? 'If you are so smart, why aren't you rich?' is a question economists have been asked in the past. Why isn't it easy to make money in financial areas even if one knows what economists know about markets, finance and the economy? And why, on the hand, is it so easy to get rich for some participants? Perhaps the answer is the real markets are complex social and cultural institutions which are quite different form organizations, administrations and the production side of the economy. The course provides an overview over social and cultural variables and patterns that play a role in economic behavior and specifically in financial markets.

SOCI30192|Graduate|Open|Tue Thu : 10:30 AM-11:50 AM|From at least the Renaissance until some time around the middle of the twentieth century, social class was the pre-eminent, generalized determinant of life chances in European and, eventually, American societies. Social class had great effect on one's social standing; economic well-being; political power; access to knowledge; and even longevity, health, and height. In that time, there was hardly an aspect of life that was not profoundly influenced by social class. In the ensuing period, the effects of social class have receded greatly, and perhaps have even vanished. In their place formal schooling has become the great generalized influence over who gets access to the desiderata of social life, including food, shelter, political power, and medical care. So it is that schooling is sociologically interesting for reasons that go well beyond education. The purpose of this course is to review what is known about the long-term effects of schooling.|Ross M Stolzenberg|TBA|The Effects of Schooling|1|[42067]|[]|LEC

Ignored by most social science theories, these new cultural initiatives and policies are increasing globally. Urban planning and architecture policies, walking and parades, posters and demonstrations, new coffee shops and storefront churches reinforce selective development of specific cities and neighborhoods. These transform our everyday social environments into new types of scenes. They factor into crucial decisions, about where to work, to open a business, to found a political activist group, to live, what political causes to support, and more. The course reviews new case studies and comparative analyses from China to Chicago to Poland that detail these processes.

SOCI30257|Graduate|Closed|Fri : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|The term “Third World” has become outmoded and politically incorrect. The category has become increasingly differentiated over time, and academic discourse has shifted its focus from difference to integration in the form of “globalization.” If, today, it would appear naïve to use the term indiscriminately, it would be equally naïve to dispense with it altogether. We continue to make the distinction between “first” and “third” worlds (although using different, euphemistic terms) because it marks real differences between domains. In this course, we take up the difference in urban structures and processes. We will consider the “Third World city” a meaningful analytical category—to be distinguished, on the one hand, from the “First World” cities that inform so much of urban sociology, and, on the other, from global cities. We will spend the course discussing how and why these cities are different. In particular, we will talk about their explosive growth in the twentieth century, the precarious nature of urban employment, informal settlement as a major urban form, the housing divide as a social structure distinct to such cities, class formation, the impact of neoliberal reforms, democratization, urban spatial restructuring in the 1990s, and urban politics.

What social variables influence and shape 'real' markets and market activities? 'If you are so smart, why aren't you rich?' is a question economists have been asked in the past. Why isn't it easy to make money in financial areas even if one knows what economists know about markets, finance and the economy? And why, on the hand, is it so easy to get rich for some participants? Perhaps the answer is the real markets are complex social and cultural institutions which are quite different form organizations, administrations and the production side of the economy. The course provides an overview over social and cultural variables and patterns that play a role in economic behavior and specifically in financial markets. The readings examine the historical and structural embeddedness of economic action and institutions, the different constructions and interpretations of money, prices, and other dimensions of a market economy, and how a financial economy affects organizations, the art and other areas.|Karin Knorr Cetina|Haskell Hall M102|Maverick Markets:  Cultural Economy and Cultural Finance|1|[54367]|[]|SEM

While the focus is on spatial aspects, the types of methods covered have general validity in statistical practice. The course covers the specification of spatial regression models in order to incorporate spatial dependence and spatial heterogeneity, as well as different estimation methods and specification tests to detect the presence of spatial autocorrelation and spatial heterogeneity. Special attention is paid to the application to spatial models of generic statistical paradigms, such as Maximum Likelihood, Generalized Methods of Moments and the Bayesian perspective.

Dramatic changes in the economic context have posed challenges to individuals, families, and communities to various degrees, which offer opportunities to revisit and possibly revise theories about human development. The class will raise big questions substantiated by the literature and will ask specific questions for empirical investigation. These questions will then evolve into research projects to be carried out collectively or individually through analyzing large-scale longitudinal data sets. The process will involve discussions of appropriate research designs, development of data analytic plans, and interpretations of empirical evidence. Throughout the course, students will receive hands-on training on how to write an empirical paper for an academic journal.

The clearest expression of its urges, of its battles, and, as Adorno would say, of its own contradictions. Catalunya is one of the most modern and European-like countries of the west. This desire for modernism is expressed in artists such as Salvador Dalí as well as the avant-garde daydreaming theater of La Fura dels Baus. In Catalunya, a small country, theater was the national defense during Franco’s dictatorship and in the present times serves as a nationalist weapon to claim independence. In this course, we will explore the history of Catalunya and Europe through theater, by means of written literature and footage of performances which will make lectures more dynamic and attractive. Also, we will meet the personal dramas of women and their social and historical implications through the theory of gender. Theater is a recreational and collective way of understanding a culture, thus it will be proposed to the students the possibility of creating a short play written and performed by them. Methodologically, the course is multifaceted and intertextual. The analysis tools are comparatist, historical, political, linguistic, psychiatric, and philosophical; the approach is creative (writing and acting) and related to cultural studies and feminism.

Psychotherapy for persons presenting with chronic distress present a unique set of challenges. Most research in psychotherapy outcomes suggest that one of the most important factors associated with successful treatment is the relationship between the client and therapist. Traditionally, focus on the therapeutic relationship has been the purview of experiential and psychodynamic therapies. However, in the past ten years, three behavioral models of psychotherapy have been introduced that focus on the relationship in the therapy session. To varying degrees, these therapies are based on a large body of knowledge developed over the past several decades in the study of verbal behavior. In this class, participants will be introduced to a behavioral conceptualization of phenomena such as emotion, memory, cognition, and beliefs. Discussion of these private behaviors will conclude in a presentation of a behavioral theory of the “sense of self”. For the remainder of the course, participants will revisit these concepts as they apply to discussion of three influential behavioral therapies. First, participants will become acquainted with specific clinician behaviors that foster the curative role of the therapist as articulated in Functional Analytic Psychotherapy (FAP) developed by Robert Kohlenberg. Second, participants will discuss the role of verbal behavior in human suffering and the “recontextualization” of painful private experience presented in Acceptance and Commitment Therapy developed by Steven Hayes. Finally, participants will be introduced to the therapeutic dialectic of acceptance and change as outlined in Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) developed by Marsha Linehan. The goal of the course will be to briefly introduce participants to FAP and ACT and to provide an overview of the principles and strategies of DBT that explicitly address the diffuse, troubling experiences presented by most chronically distressed individuals.|Jancey Wickstrom|TBA|Fundamentals of Behavioral Therapy:  Contemporary Approaches|2|[42614]|[]|LEC

The first part examines the defining features of the psychodynamic tradition and explores the growing emphasis on relational and social domains of concern in recent theory, research, and psychosocial intervention. Readings trace the development of psychodynamic understanding and social work practice, present the core concepts and essential concerns of the major schools of thought, and describe the empirical foundations of contemporary relational perspectives. The second part, focused on clinical practice, introduces principles of treatment and methods of intervention from an integrative relational perspective. Readings examine approaches to assessment, establishment of the therapeutic alliance, formulation of goals, representative forms of communication, use of interactive experience, and termination procedures. Presentations of clinical perspectives encompass a range of vulnerable groups and emphasize realistic, flexible use of strategies in view of varying levels of functioning, coping capacities, support systems, and social environments.

It is a comprehensive treatment regimen focusing on the transformation of behavior responses to intrapersonal, interpersonal and environmental factors contributing to problems related to impulsivity, emotional lability, cognitive dysregulation and interpersonal chaos. Due to its success treating various psychiatric populations, DBT is now considered effective with persons who engage in any behavior where the function of the behavior is to avoid or escape aversive thoughts and/or emotions. DBT was one of the first cognitive behavior therapies to integrate mindfulness, acceptance and willingness into treatment regimens that traditionally focus on change and control. It is therefore considered a pioneering therapy in what is now called the ""third wave"" in behaviorism. This class is intended to provide students with advanced training in the principles and practice of DBT. To that end, via lecture, experiential exercises, roleplay and a self-change project, participants will be exposed to the four components of DBT: Skills Training, Individual Therapy, Telephone Consultation and the Consultation Group. However, a basic tenet of DBT is that therapists should not expect their clients to engage in behaviors and activities they are unwilling to do. Therefore, emphasis in this class will be place on experiential knowledge. Therefore, interested participants will be expected to make a basic set of commitments that expose them to many of the emotional reactions experienced by their future clients. In addition to a self-change project, participants will commit to complete a diary card and practice mindfulness on a daily basis. Other learning activities include co-facilitating and participating in a skills group, a DBT individual therapy session and a consultation group."|E Paul Holmes|TBA|Psychthrpy: Chron Distr Pers|3|[42661]|[]|LEC

The developmental theories of Erickson and Freud offer dynamic frameworks from which to view sexuality. The exploration of sexuality becomes even more complex when the influences of family, culture, ethnicity, and religion are considered. This class will focus on the developmental aspects of sexuality relevant to each life stage as viewed through the multiple social constructions impacting sexuality, gender, and sexual orientation. Special attention will be given to marginalized sexualities, particularly women's sexuality and gay/lesbian/bisexual sexuality.

SSAD60200|Graduate|Closed|Wed : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|This course examines the experience and the role of spirituality and religious traditions in clinical social work practice with client systems. The course considers the spiritual and religious contexts shaping assessment and intervention processes in clinical social work services and examines the ways that faith traditions and spiritual experiences shape clients' and professionals' lives, and the points of connection they form with the delivery of clinical social work services. Rather than overviewing specific religious belief systems per se, this course will primarily be attuned to the ways that clients' faith traditions and spiritual experiences shape their healing and suffering. The course examines the resources as well as the dilemmas that clients' spiritual and religious traditions present in our attempts to provide effective clinical social work services, and the means by which spiritual and religious influences can be tapped by social workers to better their clients' lives. As a premise, this class takes the view that spirituality and faith traditions are experienced in a diversity of ways, and thus issues of difference and sensitivity to different expressions and experiences of spirituality and religious practice form a bedrock of considering clinical services to clients.|Stanley McCracken|TBA|Spirituality & Social Work Practice|1|[42728]|[]|LEC

SSAD63700|Graduate|Closed|Thu : 05:30 PM-06:30 PM|ACT is an example of what is commonly referred to as a third wave behavioral therapy. It is unique in its development in that it was derived from some of the implications of basic research on the function of verbal behavior. This approach suggests that psychological distress is the result of how humans relate to their psychological experience rather than the result of a mental or even biological pathology. ACT assists clients in differentiating between those aspects of life where the only viable stance is that of acceptance and willingness and those where action is required given their desire to live meaningfully. In doing so, clients fundamentally shift from having their lives about their past and their problems to a life about their values and their future. This class is intended to provide students with a comprehensive overview of and practice with the principles of ACT. To that end, via lecture, experiential exercises, role-play and a self-change project, participants will be presented with the underlying theory (Relation Frame Theory) and assumptions of ACT, an ACT conceptualization of human suffering, a model of psychological rigidity and flexibility and the six basic clinical processes. ACT emphasizes experiential knowledge over intellectual ascent.

TAML10300|Graduate|Open|Tue Thu : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM|The grammar of modern Tamil, in its manifestation both in colloquial and formal styles, and a good amount of vocabulary needed for referring to the immediate environment and using in day today transactions will be acquired. The four language skills acquired will be at different levels of proficiency with listening and speaking at the top followed by reading of formal texts and ending with basic writing skills in the formal style. The gradual progression in listening will be from teacher–student to speaker-speaker; in speaking it will be from articulation of sounds and intonation to expressing personal needs and interests, performing practical tasks, narrating experience and expressing emotions; in reading it will be from alphabet and spelling in the two styles to sign boards, controlled texts, factual news stories, interpretive reports and jokes; in writing from conversion of colloquial style into conventional style to personal letters, paraphrasing and translation of sentences. The tools used are classroom conversations, conversational tapes, videos, graded print materials, select materials from the print media including tales, which are complemented by exercises and quizzes. The basic pedagogical materials are accessible at https://tamilcourse.uchicago.edu/.|E. Annamalai|Cobb Hall 205|First-Year Tamil-3|1|[40806]|[]|LEC

TAPS28310|Undergraduate|Open|Tue Thu : 10:30 AM-11:50 AM|This course will focus on cinematographic representations of theatrical and other artistic practices, primarily exemplified by many of Ingmar Bergman's films (e.g. The Seventh Seal and Fanny and Alexander) but also in the work of other film-directors. It will explore historical and theoretical issues related to the mutual interactions between cinema and theatre also discussing cinematographic techniques in playwriting as exemplified in plays by Henrik Ibsen (e.g. Peer Gynt) and August Strindberg (e.g. A Dream Play and The Ghost Sonata). Throughout most of his creative career Bergman worked both in theatre and film and even if he is mostly known outside of Sweden as a film director, his theatrical career was as innovative. The work of the film-auteur and the theatre director are for Bergman closely connected, not only through the actors he worked with – during summers for the screen and during the theatre seasons in stage productions – but also through the choice of themes, which are often in direct dialogue with each other in the two media, generating complex meta-aesthetic, inter-medial discourses, depicting and problematizing the work and role of the artist in a broad range of social and ideological contexts.

While the genre is one often denigrated as staging lyrical utopias of Romance and adventure allowing audiences to escape depressing quotidian realities, many musicals did seek to engage some of the most pressing social issues of their day. In this course, we will look—and listen—closely to four differing musicals from the 20th century, studying their creative origins, while also analyzing their complex social meanings revealed through the story, music, lyrics, staging, and dance.

THEO40600|Graduate|Open|Wed : 12:00 PM-02:50 PM|Contemporary black theology, with its beginnings on July 31, 1966, was created by African American clergy who offered one interpretation of the new black consciousness movement of the 1960s. Already, we can see that, perhaps, black theology might be the only theological discipline in the USA that did not originate in the academy. Instead, it was birthed out of people’s everyday lives searching for human dignity and a better community on earth. The course examines the 2nd generation of black theologians, starting with 1979. As the new body of knowledge progressed, thinkers saw the necessity to clarify its conceptual, theoretical, and theological positions. An entire body of literature, over half a century of writing, has arisen defining the methodological contours of this USA creation. This course explores the responses and critiques internal to black theology. Specifically, with a firm foundation set by the 1st generation of black religious scholars (1960s), we will now review the 2nd generation (1979 onward).

This course engages a newer generation of womanist theologies. The 1979 founding and first generation of womanist scholars, especially Jacquelyn Grant, Delores Williams, and Katie Cannon, presented foundational scholarly issues, methods, and epistemologies just to begin a new academic (and life) discipline. This course will look at recent womanist scholars who build on the first generation but carry the discipline of womanist theology into some new and, at times, quite challenging directions that call into question some of the cornerstone tenets of the discipline.|Dwight Hopkins|Swift Hall 403|Womanist Theology: A New Generation|1|[41258]|[]|SEM

This course will focus on a number of medieval women writers, dealing mainly albeit not exclusively with vernacular texts. After a historical overview of the position of women in the early Middle Ages, the course will focus on Heloise and Hildegard of Bingen as transitional figures, and continue with four women writers writing in the vernacular, i.e., Mechtild of Magdeburg, Hadewijch, Marguerite Porete and Julian of Norwich. The course will link the spectrum of vernacular languages which they represent to the diversity of their individual positions and analyze that diversity in terms of ecclesiastical developments, gender division, authorial identity, and theological criticism.

UTEP35532|Graduate|Open|Wed : 09:00 AM-12:00 PM|The second year of the program, called Residency, is when student teaching will occur at school sites selected by the program. The residency/student teaching is comprised of a year-long experience consisting of two half-year placements (residents are in schools four days/week from September through January, and then again in a different school placement from January through June) in two urban schools—where they progressively assume all teaching responsibilities. The half day Residency Seminar that accompanies student teaching ensures integration between academic coursework and the residency, and provides ongoing professional development in pedagogy. Candidates concentrate on four domains of professional practice: planning, preparation, and assessment; instructional delivery; classroom environment and learning community; and professional responsibilities. They reflect on their classroom practice through video analysis, review of student work, lesson study, journal sharing, and group debriefing. They also continue their work in working with second-language learners special-needs students. Finally, the residency and seminar will integrate fine arts and health related activities into work with children as well as with the cohort.|Jeanette Bartley, Sheri Roedel|Chap 250|Residency and Seminary III|1|[42318]|[]|SEM
