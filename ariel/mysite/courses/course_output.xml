This course examines such arguments in relation to the pervasive evidence that magicality persists around precisely those sites most intimately associated with modernity's rationality and progress: the market, science and technology, and the state.

This is a history class that situates itself within a robust interdisciplinary conversation. Students can expect to engage works of autobiography and poetry, sociology, documentary photography, and political science as well as more straightforward historical analysis.

Key themes include: environmental determinism, human and non-human interactions, interpretive approaches to space and place, the role of science in archaeological and historical practice, and the compartmentalization of “environment” and “landscape” as analytic focus. These themes loom large now - during what might be called the “environmental turn” of the controversial Anthropocene in the humanities and social sciences - and their intensifying resonance provides the basis for critical reflection of the discipline’s past and future trends.|Catherine Kearns|Classics Building 021|Ancient Mediterranean Environments and Landscapes|1|[43834]|[]|LEC
ANCM449161[43840]|Graduate|Open|ANCM44916|Wed : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|"How do we know what we know about ancient religions? Historians of religion often begin by turning to texts: either sacred texts, or, in the absence of such scriptures, descriptions of belief and practice by observers from outside the faith. Archaeologists focus their attention on the spaces and traces of religious practice—or at least those that survive—while art historians begin by examining images of deities and religious rites. Yet we often fail to see the extent to which the questions which we ask of all of these diverse sources are conditioned by Christian rhetoric about pagan worship. In this course, we compare two moments when Christians encountered ""pagans"": during the initial Christian construction of a discourse on paganism (and, more broadly, a discourse on religion) during the late Roman empire and during the Spanish discovery of the New World. Our course examines silences and absences in the textual and material records, as well as the divergences between texts and objects, in order to further our understanding of ancient religious practice. We will begin to see the many ways in which, as scholars of religion, we are in effect still Christian theologians, paving the way for new approaches to the study of ancient religion."|Clifford Ando, Claudia Brittenham|Regenstein Library 207|The Discovery of Paganism|1|[43840]|[]|SEM

ANTH207021[42820]|Undergraduate|Closed|ANTH20702|Mon Wed : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM|The second segment of the African Civilizations sequence uses anthropological perspectives to investigate colonial and postcolonial encounters in West and East Africa. The course objective is to show that while colonialism was brutal and oppressive, it was by no means a unidirectional process of domination in which Europeans plundered the African continent and enforced a wholesale adoption of European culture. Rather, scholars today recognize that colonial encounters were complex culture, political, and economic fields of interaction. Africans actively adopted, reworked, and contested colonizers' policies and projects, and Europeans drew heavily from these encounters to form liberal conceptions of self, nation, and society. Over the course of the quarter, students will learn about forms of personhood, political economy, and everyday life in the twentieth century. Course themes will include social reproduction, kinship practices, medicine, domesticity, and development. Note(s): Taking these courses in sequence is recommended but not required; this sequence meets the general education requirement in civilization studies. CHDV Distribution C*.

Despite the impact of literacy on modern minds this course argues for the persistence of ancient themes, plots, characters and motifs. A further argument is made for the foundational role of storytelling in the creation of culture and construction of society. The central place of storytelling is shown in the humanistic and social sciences: anthropology, economics, history, philosophy, politics, psychoanalysis. Student storytelling and performance of brief stories is encouraged and discussed in light of the main arguments of the course.

It is at once constraint and enabler, relational and personal, “real” and “imagined.” It is both individually performed and socially determined, the site of both domination and resistance. Anthropological theory has moved far from “Cartesian dualism” in which mind and body can and must be separate; this course will travel through ways of understanding bodies that have supplemented or bypassed this idea, or have existed outside of it entirely. We will consider what it means to have a body, to know a body, to be defined by a body – in short, to live a body. This class’s topical readings are oriented around the idea that “embodiment” involves both material entities and socially embedded processes. We will consider experience, consciousness, sensation, perception, and affect; we will interrogate processes, functions, and ways of knowing that are often taken for granted; we will prise apart the ways power is inscribed on and with bodies, both internally and externally. To do so, we will balance theory and ethnography in both our consumption and production of scholarly material., including a final ""auto-ethnography"" in which students adopt a new body practice for the quarter."|Andrea Ford|Haskell Hall 315|The Lived Body: Anthropology, Materiality & Meaningful Practice|1|[43391]|[]|SEM

For historians, progress and development used to represent the very sense of universal history, a narrative that sneaked into visions of “Western modernity” and “globalization.” But later on, they became a myth to debunk rather than an object of reflection. What has “progress” meant particularly for Latin Americans? What is, for instance, the meaning of “progress” in the Brazilian flag? How did those notions shape the one of “development” since WWII? In political terms, what ideas of “progress” and “development” animated oligarchic, liberal, populist, military, revolutionary, and democratic projects across the region? Because both concepts involve planning and envisioning the outcome of present actions, the history of progress and development is also, in a certain way, a history of the future. The goal of this seminar is to help students situate a problem of their choice and trace its history in terms of the political debates that pursued the goal of progress and development in that specific realm.|Pablo Palomino|Psychology K114|Progress and Development in Latin America|1|[41612]|[]|LEC

This course explores the emergence of the 'Middle East' as an object of inquiry; a place with a people and a culture set in opposition to the 'West'. It asks how these categories are constituted, by whom, and with what consequence. How do they define the contours of political community, the possibilities for empathy and understanding or the limits of rights and moral obligation? The historical and contemporary texts assigned draw attention to the layered and shifting meanings of these categories, and in turn to the geopolitical and epistomological worlds that give rise to them. By putting these texts into conversation with each other the course engages a number of key issues that have occupied social theorists: the relationship between power and knowledge, the politics of representation, and the nature of social theory more generally.|Yaqub Hilal|TBA|Rethinking the Middle East|1|[54395]|[]|SEM

Why isn't it easy to make money in financial areas even if one knows what economists know about markets, finance and the economy? And why, on the hand, is it so easy to get rich for some participants? Perhaps the answer is the real markets are complex social and cultural institutions which are quite different form organizations, administrations and the production side of the economy. The course provides an overview over social and cultural variables and patterns that play a role in economic behavior and specifically in financial markets.

Bronze objects, in the forms of vessels, weapons, and musical instruments, were reserved for the upper ruling class of the society and were used mostly as paraphernalia during rituals and feasting. “Bronze Age” in China also indicates the emergence and eventual maturation of states with their bureaucratic systems, the presence of urban centers, a sophisticated writing system, and advanced craft producing industries, especially metal production. This course surveys the important archaeological finds of Bronze Age China and the theoretical issues such as state formation, craft production, writing, bureaucratic systems, urbanization, warfare, and inter-regional interaction, etc. It emphasizes a multi-disciplinary approach with readings and examples from anthropology, archaeology, art history, and epigraphy.

The course takes a genealogical approach to “anthropological theory” by tracking the formation, uptake and entailment's of different problem-spaces in anthropology—that is, the distinct complex of questions-and-answers around key themes and problems, which animate the discipline’s various modes of knowledge production. The course takes seriously the interplay of ethnographic inquiry and theory building and of professional practice and public engagement in the development of anthropology as a modern (and postmodern) discipline. While many of the concepts explored here will be recognizable as part of the “bread and butter” of anthropological research, the course is less interested in providing a comprehensive survey of 20th century anthropology than in interrogating the discipline’s signature style of theory building through ethnographic engagements in “the field.” We start from the premise that anthropological theory is a dialectical practice through which realist arguments about the historical world(s)—and the human’s place in it—are honed through empirical encounters and pushback from anthropology’s ethnographic subjects. Ultimately, the course hopes to track how anthropological ways of knowing intervene in the world through the making and stabilizing of particular lived concepts; that is, we ask after theory’s historical formation and durable effects, its social life, as well as afterlives, in the discipline and beyond.|Julie Chu|Wilder House 101|Develop Social Cultural Thry-1|1|[43427]|[]|SEM

Through reading some key texts, we will analyze how disciplines such as economics, linguistics, and anthropology have conceptualized this relationship. Among many topics, we will address issues about language development and language commodification, and about notions such as linguistic market and language as public good. We will explore ways in which linguistics and economics perspectives on the role of language in economic development and that of economic factors in language practices can be mutually enriching.|Cecile Vigouroux|Rosenwald Hall 329|Language and Economy: an Interdisciplinary Approach|1|[54458]|[]|SEM

ANTH403501[43241]|Graduate|Closed|ANTH40350|Wed : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|Over recent decades research in the life sciences has increasingly drawn attention to the ways in which processes taking place outside “the body proper” profoundly shape the materializations of health and illness. Rather than understanding brains or genes as determinative and relatively immutable templates for human bodies and behaviors, researchers working on neuroplasticity and epigenetics have increasingly focused on understanding how social and material environments and experiences “get under the skin.” While many social scientists have welcomed these developments as validating long-held views about the social determination of health and illness, others have warned these seemingly paradigmatic shifts may only lead to new forms of reductionism. Perhaps most fundamentally, such emergent research has been described as the grounds for a renewed biosocial research agenda or for the rethinking of interdisciplinary work between the life and social sciences. This course traces both the discussions and their historical background, addressing topics including: the nature/culture distinction in anthropology, conceptualizations of “plasticity,” “development,” and “heredity” in the life and social sciences, and the forms of interdisciplinary exchange and conversation which biosocial research may require.|Eugene Raikhel|TBA|Assembling the Biosocial|1|[43241]|[]|SEM

This course examines such arguments in relation to the pervasive evidence that magicality persists around precisely those sites most intimately associated with modernity's rationality and progress: the market, science and technology, and the state.

Despite the impact of literacy on modern minds this course argues for the persistence of ancient themes, plots, characters and motifs. A further argument is made for the foundational role of storytelling in the creation of culture and construction of society. The central place of storytelling is shown in the humanistic and social sciences: anthropology, economics, history, philosophy, politics, psychoanalysis. Student storytelling and performance of brief stories is encouraged and discussed in light of the main arguments of the course.

ANTH467601[53793]|Graduate|Open|ANTH46760|Wed : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|“Bronze Age” in China conventionally refers to the time period from ca. 2000 BC to about 500 BC, during which bronze, an alloy of copper and other metals such as tin and lead, was the predominant medium used by the society, or to be more precise, the elite classes of the society. Bronze objects, in the forms of vessels, weapons, and musical instruments, were reserved for the upper ruling class of the society and were used mostly as paraphernalia during rituals and feasting. “Bronze Age” in China also indicates the emergence and eventual maturation of states with their bureaucratic systems, the presence of urban centers, a sophisticated writing system, and advanced craft producing industries, especially metal production. This course surveys the important archaeological finds of Bronze Age China and the theoretical issues such as state formation, craft production, writing, bureaucratic systems, urbanization, warfare, and inter-regional interaction, etc. It emphasizes a multi-disciplinary approach with readings and examples from anthropology, archaeology, art history, and epigraphy. This course will also visit the Smart Museum, the Field Museum, and the Art Institute of Chicago to take advantage of the local collections of ancient Chinese arts and archaeology.|Yung-Ti Li|Regenstein Library 420|Archaeology of Bronze Age China|1|[53793]|[]|SEM
ANTH506151[43524]|Graduate|Closed|ANTH50615|Wed : 02:30 PM-05:20 PM|Authenticity is a concept that is invoked frequently in a variety of domains and often carries a heavy effective load. It plays an especially prominent role in discussions of heritage, identity, nationalism, tradition, music, art, food, architecture, tourism, and theme parks and historical reenactment; and it has been much debated by cultural theorists, anthropologists, art critics, and ordinary consumers. This seminar examines some of the major theoretical literature that notions of authenticity have generated and examines the use of authenticity in a variety of empirical domains in an effort to trace the historical origins of the concept, its multiple meanings in different contexts, the roles it has played in the creation of social boundaries, communities, and networks, and its relationship to the production of value in consumption and commodity marketing.

ANTH582051[43532]|Graduate|Closed|ANTH58205|Thu : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|Materiality is on everyone’s lips these days. Literatures across the disciplines are full of living bodies and concrete experiences, object biographies, ‘theories of things,’ a return to ‘matter,’ ‘new’ materialisms spun out of ‘old’ ones… While generative, materiality’s ubiquity also betrays a gap, an ambiguity, an absence. For what materiality is exactly remains unsure. Some seem to use it as a descriptive shorthand for the material world. Others as an analytic tending to the materialness of existence. Or as a discourse on it. For others still, it denotes the tangible effects of actions, practice, signs, and thought. Or a framework for unpacking the relationships mediating between people and things… Conjurations abound, yet seldom escape a certain circularity (“materiality studies… materiality?”). The concept has been used to frame a near infinite horizon of topics, from artefacts, of course, to cosmology, faith, finance, and absence, encompassing phenomena both enduring and ephemeral, both there and not-there. In taking on so much, has materiality outlasted its usefulness? What analytic work did it perform in the first place? With these considerations as background, through classic and recent literatures, this seminar will examine the relevance of ‘materiality’ (epistemologically, conceptually, methodologically) to anthropologies of the contemporary world, at a time when the ontologies of old are dissolving into a bubbling landscape of mixtures, hybridities, and post-humanities, which forces us to rethink basic questions of identity, agency, ethics and politics.|Francois Richard|TBA|Materiality|1|[43532]|[]|SEM

No doubt the turbulence of contemporary events—replete with revolutions as well as rapid social and technological change—had something to do with the unprecedented ways in which nineteenth-century artists regarded and represented history, with a protean embrace of past styles. Themes and topics to be considered include Homer and the classical past; Joan of Arc and medieval revivalism; Napoleon; modern life and the uses of history; monuments; and primitivism. Engaging closely with the Classicisms exhibition on view at the Smart Museum in winter/spring 2017, the course will also examine objects from the Smart’s permanent collection and draw upon a series of critical and theoretical readings.

This course provides an introduction to the dynamic appearances of photographs through history. Rather than focusing on questions of style and subject matter, we will explore the visual “syntax” of photographic prints, exploring how the material aspects of their making can shape, alter, or determine meaning. Using materials from the Art Institute of Chicago’s Photography Collection, we will learn how to identify various kinds of photographic objects based on their visual and material attributes, building on that knowledge as a basis for art historical analysis, connoisseurship, and conservation. The course will follow a loose chronological structure, starting with early daguerreotypes and salted paper prints and ending with contemporary color and digital techniques. Along the way, we will consider: what makes photography a unified “medium”? How do the technical and aesthetic traditions of photography interact with one another? What makes some processes better suited to certain purposes than others? What variables do photographers consider while choosing a process or format? How have the changing material and visual qualities of photographs influenced ideas about photography in a general sense?|Carl Fuldner|Cochrane-Woods Art Ctr 153|COSI: How Photographs Look|1|[54504]|[]|SEM

It is not designed to be a survey course, but rather a historical investigation of certain issues and developments. We will concentrate on the following: what has been said to happen to objects when they are uprooted and moved into the museum; how and why museums have changed display practices so as to get viewers to look at art in new ways; what artists have understood museums to represent and how they have responded to that understanding in their work and their display preferences. Though reference will be made to the contemporary art world, the focus will be on materials and case studies drawn from the French Revolution through the 1960s.

Through lecture, screening and group discussions, we will trace the historical relationship between visual culture and the social sciences, uncovering how this has impacted ways of viewing objects, people and cultures within the Western tradition. Armed with this knowledge, we will consider how the ethnographer’s commitment to the study of Others has been challenged by an increasingly globalised and post-colonial world. We will explore questions of authority and subjectivity in ethnographic fieldwork. Finally, we will look to contemporary artworks and exhibitions that have reinvested in the image and practice of the ethnographer to uncover the politics and poetics of their work.

Through the study of both works of art and the writings of artists and critics, we will investigate new definitions of the art object, revolts against existing institutions of art, and the emergence of performance, media, and conceptual art. These developments will be read against social and political changes in the region, including the impasse of mid-century modernization efforts and the rise of repressive dictatorships.

No doubt the turbulence of contemporary events—replete with revolutions as well as rapid social and technological change—had something to do with the unprecedented ways in which nineteenth-century artists regarded and represented history, with a protean embrace of past styles. Themes and topics to be considered include Homer and the classical past; Joan of Arc and medieval revivalism; Napoleon; modern life and the uses of history; monuments; and primitivism. Engaging closely with the Classicisms exhibition on view at the Smart Museum in winter/spring 2017, the course will also examine objects from the Smart’s permanent collection and draw upon a series of critical and theoretical readings.

In this course, we’ll be focusing on the visual arts, and we’ll try to see how reflecting on painting, photography, installation art, and those arts that get called “decorative” gives us ways to consider the object in space, and also history, war, friendship, education, material culture, aesthetics, and coming-of-age. In writing, we will practice all kinds of forms: lyric fragments; polemics; reviews; catalog essays; museum wall texts; personal meditations on a single work; documentation of lost techniques and lost works; and history, criticism, and biography written for readers outside the academy. Students will also write a longer essay to be workshopped in class. We’ll read and discuss writers such as Susan Sontag, Geoff Dyer, Claudia Rankine, Tiana Bighorse, Rebecca Solnit, Zbigniew Herbert, Donald Judd, Octavio Paz, Mark Doty, Hervé Guibert, Kevin Young, Lawrence Weschler, and Walter Benjamin.

We will also consider the photographing of ruins, and passages from the best-known works on photography (Benjamin, Sontag, Ritchen, Fried, Azoulay). The goal is to see how ruin gazing, and its depictions (textual, imagistic, photographic, etc.) change from the ancients (Greek and Roman), to the Romantic use of ruins as a source of (pleasurable) melancholy, to the technological “advances” in targeting and decimating civilian populations that describe the Second Word War.|Jas Elsner, Francoise Meltzer|Regenstein Library 207|Ruins|1|[43836]|[]|SEM
ARTH403101[43841]|Graduate|Open|ARTH40310|Wed : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|"How do we know what we know about ancient religions? Historians of religion often begin by turning to texts: either sacred texts, or, in the absence of such scriptures, descriptions of belief and practice by observers from outside the faith. Archaeologists focus their attention on the spaces and traces of religious practice—or at least those that survive—while art historians begin by examining images of deities and religious rites. Yet we often fail to see the extent to which the questions which we ask of all of these diverse sources are conditioned by Christian rhetoric about pagan worship. In this course, we compare two moments when Christians encountered ""pagans"": during the initial Christian construction of a discourse on paganism (and, more broadly, a discourse on religion) during the late Roman empire and during the Spanish discovery of the New World. Our course examines silences and absences in the textual and material records, as well as the divergences between texts and objects, in order to further our understanding of ancient religious practice. We will begin to see the many ways in which, as scholars of religion, we are in effect still Christian theologians, paving the way for new approaches to the study of ancient religion."|Clifford Ando, Claudia Brittenham|Regenstein Library 207|The Discovery of Paganism|1|[43841]|[]|SEM

Until today the appropriation of Byzantine style is especially evident in the church of Saint Mark the Evangelist, as well as in the decoration of less-well known medieval churches of the Venetian Lagoon. During the so-called Fourth Crusade, the Sack of Constantinople has led to large-scale pillaging of the Byzantine capital and the transfer to Venice of countless Byzantine artifacts, among them are liturgical items, reliquaries, icons, and architectural spoils. How were these artifacts employed in the Venetian Lagoon for religious and political ends after being disassociated from their original contexts? What transformations did they experience with regard to usage and appearance? What kinds of new ceremonies, both religious and secular, did they inspire? What was their impact on artistic creativity and religious life in their new environment? How were they perceived intellectually, and what kinds of narratives evolved around them in Venice over the centuries? These are some of the key questions to guide our research. On a broader scale, we will investigate various phenomena of cultural transfer and ‘hybridity’ from the Middle Ages to the Baroque era.|Karin Krause|Swift Hall 201|Between East and West: Venice in the Pre-Modern Period|1|[41404]|[]|SEM

ARTH482011[54588]|Graduate|Open|ARTH48201|Tue : 03:00 PM-05:50 PM|The site of some of the most widely recognizable monuments of western art history and the home to some of the most famous artists, writers, designers, thinkers, and cultural patrons of early modern culture, Florence has long occupied a central place in a larger pan-European discourse of Modernity, Beauty, and the Individual Subject. As a result, the city itself has come to occupy a mythic position as a central hub of Western intellectual culture: uprooted from its geographical specificity by the circulation of such proper names as Machiavelli, Leonardo, Michelangelo, and unmoored from its historical heritage by the disorienting complexities of modern mass tourism. Therefore, this course seeks to re-integrate the “Renaissance” into the urban context from which it emerged, to defamiliarize it so that it can be looked at from other perspectives. It focuses on the city itself as the protagonist of some of the most important experiments in art, architecture, and urban development and shows how they were intimately connected to a lively and engaged social body. By approaching images and monuments through the spatial practices by which they were encountered by Renaissance society (rituals of conflict, contests, economic exchange, religious devotion, urban politics, identity formation, among others), students will gain a more nuanced understanding of the links between a localized urban culture and a larger intercultural and cross-temporal exchange of ideas.|Niall Atkinson|Campus North Res Commons 158|Florentine Topographies: Art, Architecture, and Urban Life|1|[54588]|[]|SEM

Through lecture, screening and group discussions, we will trace the historical relationship between visual culture and the social sciences, uncovering how this has impacted ways of viewing objects, people and cultures within the Western tradition. Armed with this knowledge, we will consider how the ethnographer’s commitment to the study of Others has been challenged by an increasingly globalised and post-colonial world. We will explore questions of authority and subjectivity in ethnographic fieldwork. Finally, we will look to contemporary artworks and exhibitions that have reinvested in the image and practice of the ethnographer to uncover the politics and poetics of their work. You will be introduced to the practices of Brad Butler and Karen Mirza, Paulo Nazareth, Marine Hugonnier, Camille Henrot, Kapwani Kiwanga et. al.

Central topics will include theories of imitation, how power exerts itself through narrative, and the work of art’s tendency to fold rather than transcend what might otherwise be perceived as linear, homogeneous time. Readings include Michael Taussig’s ""Mimesis and Alterity,"" Avital Ronell’s ""Stupidity,"" and Oswald Spengler’s ""Decline of the West.""

Adopted models can originate from a range of histories, disciplines, and communities ranging from military tactics of the Mongols, restaurant work, homological algebra, joke telling, to a favorite film or film scene, etc. Independent selection and research of the chosen source(s), as well as individual and group critiques, will facilitate development of student’s ideas to a completed project. Central topics will include theories of imitation, how power exerts itself through narrative, and the work of art’s tendency to fold rather than transcend what might otherwise be perceived as linear, homogeneous time. Readings include Michael Taussig’s ""Mimesis and Alterity,"" Avital Ronell’s ""Stupidity,"" and Oswald Spengler’s ""Decline of the West.""

ASTR127201[43024]|Undergraduate|Open|ASTR12720|Mon Wed Fri : 10:30 AM-11:20 AM|The past two decades have witnessed the discovery of planets in orbit around other stars and the characterization of extra-Solar (exo-) planetary systems. We are now able to place our Solar System into the context of other worlds and a surprising conclusion that most planetary systems look nothing like our own. A challenging next step is to find planets as small as the Earth in orbit around stars like the Sun. The architecture of planetary systems reflects the formation of the parent star and its protoplanetary disk, and how these have changed with time. This course will review the techniques for discovery of planets around other stars, what we have learned so far about exoplanetary systems, and the driving questions for the future, including the quest for habitable environments elsewhere.

Advances in genetic knowledge gained through sequencing have been applied to drug response, and identifying heritable genetic variants that predict response and toxicity is an area of great interest to researchers. The ultimate goal is to identify clinically significant variations to predict the right choice and dose of medications for individuals—""personalizing medicine."" The study of pharmacogenomics is complicated by the fact that response and toxicity are multigenic traits and are often confounded by nongenetic factors (e.g., age, co-morbidities, drug-drug interactions, environment, diet). Using knowledge of an individual's DNA sequence as an integral determinant of drug therapy has not yet become standard clinical practice; however, several genetics-guided recommendations for physicians have been developed and are highlighted. The ethics and economics of pharmacogenomics are also discussed."|R. Stephanie Huang, Barbara Stranger|TBA|Pharmacogenomics: Discovery and Implementation|1|[43382]|[]|SEM

In addition, the course will cover study design and statistic analysis of large data sets, as well as how data from different sources can be used to understand regulatory networks, i.e., systems. Statistical tools that will be introduced include linear models, likelihood-based inference, supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, methods for assessing quality of data, hidden Markov models, and controlling for false discovery rates in large data sets. Readings will be drawn from the primary literature. Evaluation will be based primarily on problem sets.|Yoav Gilad|BioSci Learning Center 218|Genomics and Systems Biology|1|[42444]|[]|LEC

While wisdom has received less scholarly attention in modern times, it has recently re-emerged in popular discourse with a growing recognition of its potential importance for addressing complex issues in many domains. But what is wisdom? It’s often used with a meaning more akin to ""smart"" or ""clever."" Is it just vast knowledge? This course will examine the nature of wisdom—how it has been defined, how its meaning has changed, and what its essential components might be. We will examine how current psychological theories conceptualize wisdom and consider whether, and how, wisdom can be studied scientifically; that is, can wisdom be measured and experimentally manipulated to illuminate its underlying mechanisms and understand its functions? Finally, we will explore how concepts of wisdom can be applied in business, education, medicine, the law, and in the course of our everyday lives. Readings will be drawn from a wide array of disciplines including philosophy, classics, history, psychology, behavioral economics, medicine, and public policy."|W.

Co-taught by a historian and theater-maker, the course will consider various paradigms for looking at how artists work on human rights. Course work will include critical readings, viewings of artistic work, and direct conversations with artists. Students will also participate in a multi-day summit on campus (April 29-May 2) that will bring distinguished artists from throughout the world to address the question “What is an artistic practice of human rights, conceptually, aesthetically and pragmatically?” Students will be given the option to produce either an academic or artistic final project.|Mark Bradley, Leslie Danzig|Logan Center 501|Art and Human Rights|1|[41030]|[]|SEM
BPRO267501[41035]|Undergraduate|Closed|BPRO26750|Mon : 12:30 PM-03:20 PM|The phenomenon of anxiety emerged as one of the leading psychological disorders of the 20th and 21st centuries. Worrying ourselves into the realm of the pathological, we now have a requisite measure of anxiety for every prescribed stage of life. But why are we so anxious? Considering its prevalence in everyday life, the concept and theories of anxiety have been employed surprisingly seldom as a way into film, fiction, and art. In this course we examine the modern origin of contemporary discourses specific to anxiety and their unique manifestation in cultural artifacts. To understand the complex of anxiety in the so-called Western world, we rely on the theories of Søren Kierkegaard, Martin Heidegger, Sigmund Freud, Jacques Lacan, and Alenka Zupančič; fiction by Stoker, Schnitzler, Kafka, and Sebald; and film by Haneke, Kubrick, Ophuls, and Hitchcock. We will also have guest speakers from the fields of clinical psychiatry, geriatric medicine, philosophy, and comparative anthropology.|Anne Flannery, Malynne Sternstein|Social Sciences Rsch Bldg 401|Anxiety|1|[41035]|[]|SEM

Alternating lecture and discussion lectures will explore and tease apart the controversies in the field that limit progress in cancer prevention, diagnosis and treatment. At the end of the course, students should have an in-depth understanding of the complexities, challenges and opportunities facing modern cancer researchers and clinical oncologists and be able to discuss novel scientific approaches to solving these issues.|Kay Macleod|TBA|Heterogeneity in Human Cancer: Etiology and Treatment|1|[42462]|[]|LEC

This is a primary literature-based course that tracks our outstanding CCB Seminar Series and also incorporates seminars of interest from other Divisional programs. Typically, students meet to discuss research papers published by the following week’s seminar speaker, attend the seminar, and then meet with the speaker afterward. Faculty hosts of outside speakers are also encouraged to attend the relevant class. The goal of the course is to broaden the student’s exposure to current cutting edge research and to encourage discussion of scientific ideas among peers, as well introduce students to some of the major figures in cancer research with whom they may pursue future post-doctoral opportunities. All students start with an “A” grade but lose grade points if class performance or attendance is inadequate.

Advances in genetic knowledge gained through sequencing have been applied to drug response, and identifying heritable genetic variants that predict response and toxicity is an area of great interest to researchers. The ultimate goal is to identify clinically significant variations to predict the right choice and dose of medications for individuals—""personalizing medicine."" The study of pharmacogenomics is complicated by the fact that response and toxicity are multigenic traits and are often confounded by nongenetic factors (e.g., age, co-morbidities, drug-drug interactions, environment, diet). Using knowledge of an individual's DNA sequence as an integral determinant of drug therapy has not yet become standard clinical practice; however, several genetics-guided recommendations for physicians have been developed and are highlighted. The ethics and economics of pharmacogenomics are also discussed."|R. Stephanie Huang, Barbara Stranger|TBA|Pharmacogenomics: Discovery and Implementation|1|[43383]|[]|SEM

The clearest expression of its urges, of its battles, and, as Adorno would say, of its own contradictions. Catalunya is one of the most modern and European-like countries of the west. This desire for modernism is expressed in artists such as Salvador Dalí as well as the avant-garde daydreaming theater of La Fura dels Baus. In Catalunya, a small country, theater was the national defense during Franco’s dictatorship and in the present times serves as a nationalist weapon to claim independence. In this course, we will explore the history of Catalunya and Europe through theater, by means of written literature and footage of performances which will make lectures more dynamic and attractive. Also, we will meet the personal dramas of women and their social and historical implications through the theory of gender. Theater is a recreational and collective way of understanding a culture, thus it will be proposed to the students the possibility of creating a short play written and performed by them. Methodologically, the course is multifaceted and intertextual. The analysis tools are comparatist, historical, political, linguistic, psychiatric, and philosophical; the approach is creative (writing and acting) and related to cultural studies and feminism. The aim is to demonstrate that Catalan drama is a splendid window to get to know the Catalan culture and is fully integrated into contemporary theater.|Staff|Cobb Hall 403|Catalan Avant-Garde Theater|1|[42033]|[]|LEC

Over the course of the term, we will read literature on teaching and learning and use that scholarship to reflect on our own teaching practice. We will start at the beginning by thinking first about how people learn. Next we will turn our attention to course design and consider what kind of structure will help us promote learning in our students. We then consider assessment: how do we know students are learning, and how can the work we assign them promote meaningful engagement with course material? We will then think about what happens in the classroom by exploring different teaching methods, and what can be said for (and against) them. We will also consider the issue of inclusion in the classroom, discussing how to create a welcoming and productive classroom environment. Alongside this process of reading, reflection, and discussion, students will also be engaged in designing a course of their own. This endeavor will take the form of a course design project, which should serve as the foundation for a course you plan to teach soon, either in the College, at a Chicago-area institution, or in your first year as a faculty member. Students will also produce a statement of teaching philosophy that articulates their approach to teaching.|Joseph Lampert|TBA|Course Design and College Teaching|1|[58222]|[]|SEM

What types of ethical oversight over the responsible conduct of research have arisen over the years? We will learn how to read and critique clinical research, survey the major types of clinical research designs, and the differences between hypothesis generation and hypothesis testing. Finally, we provide an overview of the mechanics of developing and implementing clinical research, including grant writing, regulatory issues, and quality assurance. Along the way, we will be teaching core statistical concepts including prevalence, risk ratios, and sensitivity and validation techniques.

Advances in genetic knowledge gained through sequencing have been applied to drug response, and identifying heritable genetic variants that predict response and toxicity is an area of great interest to researchers. The ultimate goal is to identify clinically significant variations to predict the right choice and dose of medications for individuals—""personalizing medicine."" The study of pharmacogenomics is complicated by the fact that response and toxicity are multigenic traits and are often confounded by nongenetic factors (e.g., age, co-morbidities, drug-drug interactions, environment, diet). Using knowledge of an individual's DNA sequence as an integral determinant of drug therapy has not yet become standard clinical practice; however, several genetics-guided recommendations for physicians have been developed and are highlighted.

On ruins writing, we will read Thucydides, Pausanias from within antiquity, the Enlightenment responses to the destruction and archaeological rediscovery of Pompeii, Diderot, Simmel, Freud on the mind as levels of ruins (Rome) and the analysis as reconstructive archaeologist as well as on the novel Gradiva and the Acropolis, the Romantic obsession with ruins, and the firebombing in WWII. We will also consider the photographing of ruins, and passages from the best-known works on photography (Benjamin, Sontag, Ritchen, Fried, Azoulay). The goal is to see how ruin gazing, and its depictions (textual, imagistic, photographic, etc.) change from the ancients (Greek and Roman), to the Romantic use of ruins as a source of (pleasurable) melancholy, to the technological “advances” in targeting and decimating civilian populations that describe the Second Word War.|Jas Elsner, Francoise Meltzer|Regenstein Library 207|Ruins|1|[43835]|[]|SEM
CDIN403011[43839]|Graduate|Open|CDIN40301|Wed : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|"How do we know what we know about ancient religions? Historians of religion often begin by turning to texts: either sacred texts, or, in the absence of such scriptures, descriptions of belief and practice by observers from outside the faith. Archaeologists focus their attention on the spaces and traces of religious practice—or at least those that survive—while art historians begin by examining images of deities and religious rites. Yet we often fail to see the extent to which the questions which we ask of all of these diverse sources are conditioned by Christian rhetoric about pagan worship. In this course, we compare two moments when Christians encountered ""pagans"": during the initial Christian construction of a discourse on paganism (and, more broadly, a discourse on religion) during the late Roman empire and during the Spanish discovery of the New World. Our course examines silences and absences in the textual and material records, as well as the divergences between texts and objects, in order to further our understanding of ancient religious practice. We will begin to see the many ways in which, as scholars of religion, we are in effect still Christian theologians, paving the way for new approaches to the study of ancient religion."|Clifford Ando, Claudia Brittenham|Regenstein Library 207|The Discovery of Paganism|1|[43839]|[]|SEM

That is, how does it differ from adolescence or adulthood? Can it be considered a distinct developmental stage? In the first part of class, we will focus on life course stage theory to understand the analytic construction of life course stages. In the second part of the course, we will explore current literature on the stalled transition to social adulthood in different socio-cultural contexts and critically examine the following “new” stages: “emerging adulthood” in the US and “waithood” in the Middle East. In the third part of the class, we will turn to futurity in order to understand the link between social adulthood and projects of future making.

Each discipline highlights different aspects of human emotions: psychological studies tends to focus on individual experiences of emotion; sociological studies focus on emotion in social context; and anthropological studies focus on cultural constitution of emotions. As we critically examine psychological, sociological, and anthropological conceptions of emotion, we will aim to arrive at a comprehensive account of human emotions that neither sidelines the lived experience of emotions nor disregards their relationships to society and culture. Following a review of emotions across different disciplines in social sciences, we will visit the relationship between gender and emotion, development of emotions, and mental health and emotions.

The course objective is to show that while colonialism was brutal and oppressive, it was by no means a unidirectional process of domination in which Europeans plundered the African continent and enforced a wholesale adoption of European culture. Rather, scholars today recognize that colonial encounters were complex culture, political, and economic fields of interaction. Africans actively adopted, reworked, and contested colonizers' policies and projects, and Europeans drew heavily from these encounters to form liberal conceptions of self, nation, and society. Over the course of the quarter, students will learn about forms of personhood, political economy, and everyday life in the twentieth century. Course themes will include social reproduction, kinship practices, medicine, domesticity, and development.

Dramatic changes in the economic context have posed challenges to individuals, families, and communities to various degrees, which offer opportunities to revisit and possibly revise theories about human development. The class will raise big questions substantiated by the literature and will ask specific questions for empirical investigation. These questions will then evolve into research projects to be carried out collectively or individually through analyzing large-scale longitudinal data sets. The process will involve discussions of appropriate research designs, development of data analytic plans, and interpretations of empirical evidence. Throughout the course, students will receive hands-on training on how to write an empirical paper for an academic journal.

We will supplement this discussion with an inquiry into the possibility and limits of self without an other, and visit the question of how human consciousness differs from that of other primates. In the course of our discussions, we will critically engage issues concerning the development of the self, its unity, individuality, and agency, and the possibilities of creativity, resistance and the transformation of the self. By the end of the quarter, you are expected to develop a deeper understanding of the relationship between self and other.|Sevda Numanbayraktaroglu|Rosenwald Hall 329|Self and Other|1|[43257]|[]|SEM

CHDV432551[43240]|Graduate|Closed|CHDV43255|Wed : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|Over recent decades research in the life sciences has increasingly drawn attention to the ways in which processes taking place outside “the body proper” profoundly shape the materializations of health and illness. Rather than understanding brains or genes as determinative and relatively immutable templates for human bodies and behaviors, researchers working on neuroplasticity and epigenetics have increasingly focused on understanding how social and material environments and experiences “get under the skin.” While many social scientists have welcomed these developments as validating long-held views about the social determination of health and illness, others have warned these seemingly paradigmatic shifts may only lead to new forms of reductionism. Perhaps most fundamentally, such emergent research has been described as the grounds for a renewed biosocial research agenda or for the rethinking of interdisciplinary work between the life and social sciences. This course traces both the discussions and their historical background, addressing topics including: the nature/culture distinction in anthropology, conceptualizations of “plasticity,” “development,” and “heredity” in the life and social sciences, and the forms of interdisciplinary exchange and conversation which biosocial research may require.|Eugene Raikhel|TBA|Assembling the Biosocial|1|[43240]|[]|SEM

This course will provide an introduction to sociological perspectives on gender, physical and mental health, and medicine while also providing a deep interrogation of the social, institutional, and biological links between gender and health. We will discuss inequalities in morbidity, mortality, and health behaviors of women, men, and transgendered individuals from different race, ethnic, and class backgrounds, and we will use sociological concepts, theories, and methods to understand why these differences appear. Finally, we will examine how medicine as an institution and medical practices as organizations sometimes contribute to and combat gender inequality in health. By the end of the course, you will be familiar with social scientific perspectives on (1) gender, (2) mental and physical health, and (3) the practice of medicine, as well as some of the fundamental debates in current medical sociology and sociology of gender.|Anna Mueller|Rosenwald Hall 329|Gender, Health & Medicine|1|[43242]|[]|SEM

An historical approach is taken in which the roots of current research issues and practices are traced. Topics are drawn from the following areas: evaluation and choice when goals are in conflict and must be traded off, decision making when consequences of the decision are uncertain, predictive and evaluative judgments under conditions of uncertain, incomplete, conflicting, or otherwise fallible information.|William Goldstein|Psychology G104|Sem: Topics in Judgment and Decision Making|1|[41275]|[]|SEM

In recent years it has become apparent that much of an organisms genome is transcribed, yielding a far more expansive collection of RNA molecules than previously thought: many of these RNAs are classic messenger RNAs that code for proteins but many serve functions other than protein coding (noncoding RNAs). These RNAs are processed, modified, and usually interact with RNA binding proteins (RBPs) to form ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes. We will consider emerging themes in noncoding RNA biology and investigate methods for interrogating their cellular structure and function.|Joseph A Piccirilli|Kent Chem Lab 103|RNA Special Topics|1|[54337]|[]|LEC

The perceived fissure between the “Two Cultures” has been deepened by the fact that the bulk of all history and philosophy of science has been devoted to the natural sciences. This seminar addresses the history and epistemology of what in the nineteenth century came to be called the “sciences” and the “humanities” since the Renaissance from an integrated perspective. The historical sources will focus on shared practices in, among others, philology, natural history, astronomy, and history.

Students will examine the theoretical and methodological groundings of cultural psychiatry, examining how scholars working in the phenomenological tradition have tried to describe the lived experiences of various forms of “psychopathology” or “madness.” By the end of the course, students will have learned how to describe and analyze the social dimension of a mental health experience, using a phenomenologically-grounded anthropological approach, and by adopting a technical vocabulary for understanding the lived experiences of mental illness (for instance, phenomena, life-world, being-in-the-world, intentionality, epoché, embodiment, madness, psychopathology, melancholia/depression, schizophrenia, etc). In addition, given the ongoing problematic of “how to represent mental illness,” students will also have the opportunity to think through the different ways of presenting their analysis, both in the form of weekly blog entries and during a final-week mock-workshop, where they will showcase their work in a creative medium appropriate to that analysis.|Francis McKay|Saieh Hall for Economics 247|Experiencing Madness: Empathic Methods in Cultural Psychiatry|1|[53674]|[]|SEM

First, science has been the subject of artistic representation, in painting and photography, in poetry and novels (e.g., in Byron’s poetry, for example). Second, science has been used to explain aesthetic effects (e.g., Helmholtz’s work on the way painters achieve visual effects or musicians achieve tonal effects). Third, aesthetic means have been used to convey scientific conceptions (e.g., through illustrations in scientific volumes or through aesthetically affective and effective writing). Finally, philosophers have stepped back to consider the relationship between scientific knowing and aesthetic comprehension (e.g., Kant, Bas van Fraassen); much of the discussion of this latter will focus on the relation between images and what they represent. In this lecture-discussion course we will consider all of these aspects of the science-aesthetic connection.|Robert Richards|TBA|Science and Aesthetics in the 18th-21st Centuries|1|[42919]|[]|SEM

Historians of religion often begin by turning to texts: either sacred texts, or, in the absence of such scriptures, descriptions of belief and practice by observers from outside the faith. Archaeologists focus their attention on the spaces and traces of religious practice—or at least those that survive—while art historians begin by examining images of deities and religious rites. Yet we often fail to see the extent to which the questions which we ask of all of these diverse sources are conditioned by Christian rhetoric about pagan worship. In this course, we compare two moments when Christians encountered ""pagans"": during the initial Christian construction of a discourse on paganism (and, more broadly, a discourse on religion) during the late Roman empire and during the Spanish discovery of the New World. Our course examines silences and absences in the textual and material records, as well as the divergences between texts and objects, in order to further our understanding of ancient religious practice. We will begin to see the many ways in which, as scholars of religion, we are in effect still Christian theologians, paving the way for new approaches to the study of ancient religion."|Clifford Ando, Claudia Brittenham|Regenstein Library 207|The Discovery of Paganism|1|[43842]|[]|SEM

The New Latin American Cinema (NLAC) of the late 1950s-70s generated unprecedented international enthusiasm for Latin American film production. The filmmakers of this loosely designated movement were defining themselves in relation to global realist film traditions like Italian Neorealism and Griersonian documentary, in relation to--mostly failed-- experiments in building Hollywood-style national film industries, and in relation to regional discourses of underdevelopment and mestizaje. Since the late 1990s, a reassessment of the legacy of the NLAC has been taking shape as scholars have begun to interrogate its canonical status in the face of a changed political climate. In the sphere of filmmaking, contemporary Latin American new wave cinemas are also grappling with that legacy-sometimes disavowing it, sometimes appropriating it. We will situate the NLAC in its historical context, survey its formal achievements and political aspirations, assess its legacy, and take stock of the ways and the reasons that it haunts contemporary production.|Staff|TBA|The New Latin American Cinema and Its Afterlife|1|[53555]|[]|SEM

From the earliest shatranj puzzles of the sixth-century to the chess schools of the Soviet Union, societies across the world have turned to the game for intellectual challenge and to sharpen mental acuity. As the quintessential activity of human reasoning, chess soon became a favorite subject for cognitive science research, yielding insights into search methods, memory, judgment, and problem-solving strategies. In this course, we will read select chess narratives in tandem with supplementary readings on cognition to understand the role of game playing in cultural imagination beyond metaphor. These supplementary readings will explore evaluative judgments, memory processes, and human perception, among other topics. We will examine various works of troubled genius, beginning with Vladimir Nabokov’s 1930 tale of chess and obsession, The Defense.

In this course we try to understand these emotional attachments by examining the narrative of loss and redemption through which most nations in the Balkans retell their Ottoman past. We begin by considering the mythic temporality of the Romantic national narrative while focusing on specific national literary texts where the national past is retold through the formula of original wholeness, foreign invasion, Passion, and Salvation. We then proceed to unpack the structural role of the different elements of that narrative. With the help of Žižek’s theory of the subject as constituted by trauma, we think about the national fixation on the trauma of loss, and the role of trauma in the formation of national consciousness. Specific theme inquiries involve the figure of the Janissary as self and other, brotherhood and fratricide, and the writing of the national trauma on the individual physical body. Special attention is given to the general aesthetic of victimhood, the casting of the victimized national self as the object of the “other’s perverse desire.” With the help of Freud, Žižek, and Kant we consider the transformation of national victimhood into the sublimity of the national self. The main primary texts include Petar Njegoš’ Mountain Wreath (Serbia and Montenegro), Ismail Kadare’s The Castle (Albania), Anton Donchev’s Time of Parting (Bulgaria).|Angelina Ilieva|Stuart Hall 104|The Burden of History: The Nation and Its Lost Paradise|1|[42374]|[]|LEC

Indeed, it is guaranteed in the very etymology of the French and German words “mode” and “modernité”. Yet, on closer inspection, there is a blind spot in this relation in that fashion seems rather to be the Other of modernity than modernity itself, an Oriental colony in the heart of the West. The modern discourse of fashion testifies to the ambivalences and paradoxes in this relationship. From the beginning of the modern world until now, it is strangely split: there is fashion and fashion. Properly speaking, men’s fashion is not really fashionable. The perfectly functional suit without superfluous adornment is, in its world-wide constancy through the centuries, almost invariably classical. Its staggering universal success is due to the fact that it is the ideal modern dress: beautiful, because functional. Women’s fashion, on the contrary, is a remnant of the old, effeminate aristocracy – a frivolous frill, an all-in-all dysfunctional ornament, badly in need of thorough modernization. The „new woman“ is born in agonizing pain and perpetual fallbacks: while Chanel almost lead us toward a functional feminine form, Dior’s new look was, from this perspective, a setback: it brought back the unhealthy, restrictive corset and offered a slap in the face to the modern aesthetic dogma of „form follows function“. Fashion therefore seems to be the locus of a strange intimation of the political set against the common politics of modernity. By reading texts form Friedrich Nietzsche to Adolf Loos and Thorstein Veblen, Rousseau to Baudelaire, from Gautier, Zola and Apollinaire to Simone de Beauvoir and Pierre Bourdieu, the course will center around this blind spot between fashion and modernity and the new gendering of fashion in the bourgeois, post-feudal era.|Barbara Vinken|Classics Building 313|Fashion and Modernity|1|[53927]|[]|SEM

In the early twentieth century the novel-memoir becomes arguably the foremost vehicle for literary modernism. We will examine the literary strategies used to represent the workings of memory and the construction of their autobiographical worlds. What role does tradition play in foregrounding the writers’ approach to their immediate familial and cultural past? How is the experience of time reconfigured by the processes of memory, and what rhetorical techniques are used to effect this in prose narratives? Readings may include James Joyce’s A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, Andrei Bely’s Kotik Letaev, Virginia Woolf’s To the Lighthouse, Osip Mandelshtam’s The Noise of Time and Vladimir Nabokov’s Speak, Memory, as well as selections from Boris Pasternak, Marcel Proust, Andrei Platonov, Marina Tsvetaeva and others.

Readings will engage with the variety of aesthetic functions that the disgusting has been afforded throughout modern literary history, including the carnivalesque and grotesque in Rabelais and the bawdy and satirical in Swift; revolted Victorian realism and gruesome Zolaesque naturalism; and Sartre’s existential nausea and Kafka’s anxious repulsion; as well as Thomas Bernhard’s experiments with contempt and William Burroughs’ hallucinogenic inversions of pleasure and disgust.

The course not only introduces some theoretical and intermedial problems of adaptation of literature to film but also address cultural and political implications of Kurosawa’s adaptation of classic and foreign sources. We will study how Kurosawa’s turn to literary adaptation provided a vehicle for circumventing social taboos of his time and offered a screen for addressing politically sensitive and sometimes censored topics of Japan’s militarist past, war crimes, defeat in the Second World War, and ideological conflicts of reconstruction. The course combines film analysis with close reading of relevant literary sources, contextualized by current work of political, economic, and cultural historians of postwar Japan.

In this course we try to understand these emotional attachments by examining the narrative of loss and redemption through which most nations in the Balkans retell their Ottoman past. We begin by considering the mythic temporality of the Romantic national narrative while focusing on specific national literary texts where the national past is retold through the formula of original wholeness, foreign invasion, Passion, and Salvation. We then proceed to unpack the structural role of the different elements of that narrative. With the help of Žižek’s theory of the subject as constituted by trauma, we think about the national fixation on the trauma of loss, and the role of trauma in the formation of national consciousness. Specific theme inquiries involve the figure of the Janissary as self and other, brotherhood and fratricide, and the writing of the national trauma on the individual physical body. Special attention is given to the general aesthetic of victimhood, the casting of the victimized national self as the object of the “other’s perverse desire.” With the help of Freud, Žižek, and Kant we consider the transformation of national victimhood into the sublimity of the national self. The main primary texts include Petar Njegoš’ Mountain Wreath (Serbia and Montenegro), Ismail Kadare’s The Castle (Albania), Anton Donchev’s Time of Parting (Bulgaria).|Angelina Ilieva|Stuart Hall 104|The Burden of History: The Nation and Its Lost Paradise|1|[42375]|[]|LEC

While in an age of global migrations, multilingual speakers have come to outnumber the number of monolingual speakers, literary studies continue to privilege works aimed at a monolingual audience. This is particularly the case in the United States, where “English-only” attitudes have dominated discourse for over a century. This course instead explores literary works that take up residence in the space between two or more languages, whether national or regional—as well as those that attempt to dodge semantic systems altogether. From modernist collage and transense to contemporary poetry of exile, migration, and diaspora, the works we will study, lodged between tongues, lend nuance and fascination to debates surrounding “global literature” and untranslatability. We will examine the formal and social prompts and repercussions of experiments in polylingualism, barbarism, dialect, creole, and thwarted translation, and will delve into examples of the potential for mixed/new media poetics to accommodate multiple linguistic systems. While it is not at all necessary for students to be fluent in more than one language to take this course, some experience learning or attempting to learn languages beyond English is essential.

Basic formal elements and principles of art are presented, but also put into practice to reveal perennial issues in a visual field. Form is studied as a means to communicate content. Topics as varied as but not limited to narrative, mechanical reproduction, verisimilitude, historical tableaux, time and memory, the body politic, and the role of the author can be illuminated through these primary investigations. Some sections focus solely on performance; others incorporate moving image technology. Please check the time schedule for details. Visits to museums and other fieldwork required, as is participation in studio exercises and group critiques. Students must attend class for the full first week in order to confirm enrollment. Pink slip/wait list requests are due several weeks before the quarter begins. Sign up for the wait list at dova.uchicago.edu/content/wait-list-core-courses-0.

CMST145091[43909]|Undergraduate|Closed|CMST14509|Tue Thu : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM|The uncanny is an experience or quality that by definition remains difficult to grasp; something that is mysterious and enigmatic, yet also seems oddly familiar. It is an atmosphere, mood or perhaps a theme that movies have explores since nearly the beginning of cinema (or perhaps even before..) To explore this term this class will draw largely on a tradition of commentary on the German word Das Unheimliche, usually translated as uncanny, that can be traced among Ernst Jentsch, Sigmund Freud, and Martin Heidegger and its relevance to film studies. Freud and his disciple Otto Rank before 1920 related the uncanny to the cinema, and cinema’s ability to evoke the uncanny has been frequently observed. On the one hand, the cinema’s ability to portray uncanny events (as in Rank and Freud’s invocation of the 1913 film the Student in Prague) appears generically in films of fantasy or horror. In addition, some theorists have felt that film as a medium could be best approached via the uncanny. In this class, we will read a series of the key texts and try to survey the terrain of the concept of the uncanny. We will screen films that evoke the experience through their narrative and stylistics, and we will discuss the usefulness of the term for theorizing both film and electronic media, both new and old.|Thomas R Gunning|Logan Center 801|The Uncanny in Cinema|1|[43909]|[{'sectionname': 'Section 1S01 [43910] - SCR Closed', 'instructor': 'Gunning', 'daytime': 'Wed : 07:00 PM-10:00 PM'}]|LEC

The New Latin American Cinema (NLAC) of the late 1950s-70s generated unprecedented international enthusiasm for Latin American film production. The filmmakers of this loosely designated movement were defining themselves in relation to global realist film traditions like Italian Neorealism and Griersonian documentary, in relation to--mostly failed-- experiments in building Hollywood-style national film industries, and in relation to regional discourses of underdevelopment and mestizaje. Since the late 1990s, a reassessment of the legacy of the NLAC has been taking shape as scholars have begun to interrogate its canonical status in the face of a changed political climate. In the sphere of filmmaking, contemporary Latin American new wave cinemas are also grappling with that legacy-sometimes disavowing it, sometimes appropriating it.

The course not only introduces some theoretical and intermedial problems of adaptation of literature to film but also address cultural and political implications of Kurosawa’s adaptation of classic and foreign sources. We will study how Kurosawa’s turn to literary adaptation provided a vehicle for circumventing social taboos of his time and offered a screen for addressing politically sensitive and sometimes censored topics of Japan’s militarist past, war crimes, defeat in the Second World War, and ideological conflicts of reconstruction. The course combines film analysis with close reading of relevant literary sources, contextualized by current work of political, economic, and cultural historians of postwar Japan.

We will engage in rigorous examination of the transformations of cinematic forms and contents, and of the social, cultural and political elements bound up with those transformations. Over the quarter, you will also learn the tools necessary to analyze documentaries. The course assumes no prior knowledge of film or documentary theory. Each week we will engage with theoretical or analytical readings, through which we will explore 1) how particular ethics and politics are imbricated in various documentary modes and genres and 2) the specific cases of Japanese documentaries and their styles/techniques, measuring them against today’s media regime (and measuring that regime against them). Various traces of Japanese documentary filmmaking practice can be seen carried forward and extended in cinematic creations worldwide, from works by Chris Marker, Abbas Kiarostami and Wim Wenders to recent independent documentaries in East Asia. To locate such traces in the transnational framework, the final sections of the course will be devoted to China’s new documentary film movement since the 1990s and contemporary Taiwanese documentaries.|Takuya Tsunoda|Cobb Hall 307|(Re-)Presenting the Real:  Nonfiction Cinema in Japan and East Asia|1|[54725]|[{'sectionname': 'Section 1S01 [54726] - SCR Open', 'instructor': 'Tsunoda', 'daytime': 'Wed : 07:00 PM-10:00 PM'}]|LEC

We will then consider its influence on contemporary art cinema, from Aleksandr Sokurov and Béla Tarr to Nuri Bilge Ceylan and Alejandro González Iñárritu (Birdman). Along the way we will also consider the long-take style in documentary cinema, and will also consider the links between long-take cinema and certain tendencies in video art, exemplified by the work in video of Sharon Lockhart and James Benning. We will close by considering the feature films of artists Steve McQueen and Lucien Castaing-Taylor. Treating long-take style as a distinct approach to cinematic realism, in each case we will evaluate the claims made for the ethical, metaphysical and even political valences of the long take, with readings by filmmakers and by theorists from Henri Bergson and André Bazin to Gilles Deleuze, Jacques Rancière, Laura Mulvey and beyond.|Robert Bird|Cobb Hall 311|Long-Take Cinema|1|[43931]|[{'sectionname': 'Section 1S01 [43932] - SCR Open', 'instructor': 'Staff', 'daytime': 'Mon : 03:30 PM-06:30 PM'}]|LEC

He asked the question hanging in the minds of generations of filmmakers around the world, most likely including Lubitsch himself. In a career spanning nearly three decades, Lubitsch’s name has come to denote a style about style, first exported from Germany to Hollywood and then from Hollywood to the world. In this sense, Lubitsch is first and foremost a filmmaker for filmmakers, and his style decidedly an international one. It is the goal of this course to examine a broadly defined international stylistic history developed by and associated with Lubitsch, whose legacy cannot be adequately assessed without such a perspective. With dual emphases on formal and historical analyses, we will look at Lubitsch’s early Weimar comedy and epic films, American silent masterpieces, musicals, sound comedies, and political farces, as well as Lubitsch-esque films made in Japan, China, and France.|Xinyu Dong|Cobb Hall 310|Ernst Lubitsch:  An International Style|1|[43948]|[{'sectionname': 'Section 1S01 [43949] - SCR Open', 'instructor': 'Staff', 'daytime': 'Tue : 07:00 PM-10:00 PM'}]|LEC

It will explore historical and theoretical issues related to the mutual interactions between cinema and theatre also discussing cinematographic techniques in playwriting as exemplified in plays by Henrik Ibsen (e.g. Peer Gynt) and August Strindberg (e.g. A Dream Play and The Ghost Sonata). Throughout most of his creative career Bergman worked both in theatre and film and even if he is mostly known outside of Sweden as a film director, his theatrical career was as innovative. The work of the film-auteur and the theatre director are for Bergman closely connected, not only through the actors he worked with – during summers for the screen and during the theatre seasons in stage productions – but also through the choice of themes, which are often in direct dialogue with each other in the two media, generating complex meta-aesthetic, inter-medial discourses, depicting and problematizing the work and role of the artist in a broad range of social and ideological contexts.

To answer Adrian Martin’s call for “Musical Mutations: Before, Beyond and Against Hollywood,” this course will look for Chinese musicals in both obvious and unlikely places. The “musical mutations” under discussion include traditional opera adaptation, back-stage opera film, martial-arts opera film, Maoist opera film, musical comedy, song-and-dance film, melo-drama, Hong Kong musical, and most certainly the “apocalyptic” musical named by Martin, The Hole (Tsai Ming-liang, 1998). The tripartite developments of Chinese-language cinemas provide a privileged site to chart the ways the musical genre expands, transforms, and rejuvenates across time and borders.|Xinyu Dong|Cobb Hall 425|Chinese Musicals|1|[43913]|[{'sectionname': 'Section 1S01 [43914] - SCR Open', 'instructor': 'Dong', 'daytime': 'Mon : 07:00 PM-10:00 PM'}]|LEC

It will also look at other forms of documentary media, such as photograpy and written reportage. We will pay particular attention to the political and social movements in which these filmmakers and artists participated--from Pacific War-era propaganda to 1960s radicalism. We will also look at theoretical approaches to documentary produced in Japan and elsewhere. What kind of reality does documentary seek to represent?

CMST349221[53940]|Graduate|Open|CMST34922|Fri : 11:30 AM-02:20 PM|This interdisciplinary graduate and advanced undergraduate course focuses on ten films of Akira Kurosawa which were based on literary sources ranging from Ryunosuke Akutagawa, Georges Simenon, and Shakespeare to Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, Gorky, and Arseniev. The course not only introduces some theoretical and intermedial problems of adaptation of literature to film but also address cultural and political implications of Kurosawa’s adaptation of classic and foreign sources. We will study how Kurosawa’s turn to literary adaptation provided a vehicle for circumventing social taboos of his time and offered a screen for addressing politically sensitive and sometimes censored topics of Japan’s militarist past, war crimes, defeat in the Second World War, and ideological conflicts of reconstruction. The course combines film analysis with close reading of relevant literary sources, contextualized by current work of political, economic, and cultural historians of postwar Japan. The course is meant to provide hands-on training in the interdisciplinary methodology of Comparative Literature.|Olga Solovieva|TBA|Kurosawa and His Sources|1|[53940]|[]|SEM
CMST349241[54727]|Graduate|Open|CMST34924|Tue Thu : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM|The primary aim of the course is to investigate the historical trajectory of the theories and practices of documentary film in Japan from the 1920s to the present. We will engage in rigorous examination of the transformations of cinematic forms and contents, and of the social, cultural and political elements bound up with those transformations. Over the quarter, you will also learn the tools necessary to analyze documentaries. The course assumes no prior knowledge of film or documentary theory. Each week we will engage with theoretical or analytical readings, through which we will explore 1) how particular ethics and politics are imbricated in various documentary modes and genres and 2) the specific cases of Japanese documentaries and their styles/techniques, measuring them against today’s media regime (and measuring that regime against them). Various traces of Japanese documentary filmmaking practice can be seen carried forward and extended in cinematic creations worldwide, from works by Chris Marker, Abbas Kiarostami and Wim Wenders to recent independent documentaries in East Asia. To locate such traces in the transnational framework, the final sections of the course will be devoted to China’s new documentary film movement since the 1990s and contemporary Taiwanese documentaries.|Takuya Tsunoda|Cobb Hall 307|(Re-)Presenting the Real:  Nonfiction Cinema in Japan and East Asia|1|[54727]|[{'sectionname': 'Section 1S01 [54728] - SCR Open', 'instructor': 'Tsunoda', 'daytime': 'Wed : 07:00 PM-10:00 PM'}]|LEC

CMST355061[43933]|Graduate|Open|CMST35506|Tue Thu : 10:30 AM-11:50 AM|As a stylistic device, the long take has long been a definitive feature of art cinema, being particularly conspicuous in filmmakers who make ethical and even metaphysical claims for their “slow cinema.” After surveying the use of the long take in silent and classical cinema (including Orson Welles and Alfred Hitchcock), we will concentrate on the long-take style that spanned the art cinemas of Western Europe (Michelangelo Antonioni, Chantal Akerman), Russia and Eastern Europe (Miklós Jancsó, Andrei Tarkovsky), and Central Eurasia (Ebrahim Golestan). We will then consider its influence on contemporary art cinema, from Aleksandr Sokurov and Béla Tarr to Nuri Bilge Ceylan and Alejandro González Iñárritu (Birdman). Along the way we will also consider the long-take style in documentary cinema, and will also consider the links between long-take cinema and certain tendencies in video art, exemplified by the work in video of Sharon Lockhart and James Benning. We will close by considering the feature films of artists Steve McQueen and Lucien Castaing-Taylor. Treating long-take style as a distinct approach to cinematic realism, in each case we will evaluate the claims made for the ethical, metaphysical and even political valences of the long take, with readings by filmmakers and by theorists from Henri Bergson and André Bazin to Gilles Deleuze, Jacques Rancière, Laura Mulvey and beyond.|Robert Bird|Cobb Hall 311|Long-Take Cinema|1|[43933]|[{'sectionname': 'Section 1S01 [43934] - SCR Open', 'instructor': 'Staff', 'daytime': 'Mon : 03:30 PM-06:30 PM'}]|LEC

In the second part of the course, we will narrow our focus to melodramas from the two regions: the United States and Latin America. The conceit of the course is to put different regional traditions of melodrama into conversation. In addition to offering a basic orientation, the class will also test the boundaries of the category in our work on the racial melodrama and the conjuncture of documentary form and melodrama.

He asked the question hanging in the minds of generations of filmmakers around the world, most likely including Lubitsch himself. In a career spanning nearly three decades, Lubitsch’s name has come to denote a style about style, first exported from Germany to Hollywood and then from Hollywood to the world. In this sense, Lubitsch is first and foremost a filmmaker for filmmakers, and his style decidedly an international one. It is the goal of this course to examine a broadly defined international stylistic history developed by and associated with Lubitsch, whose legacy cannot be adequately assessed without such a perspective. With dual emphases on formal and historical analyses, we will look at Lubitsch’s early Weimar comedy and epic films, American silent masterpieces, musicals, sound comedies, and political farces, as well as Lubitsch-esque films made in Japan, China, and France.|Xinyu Dong|Cobb Hall 310|Ernst Lubitsch:  An International Style|1|[43950]|[{'sectionname': 'Section 1S01 [43951] - SCR Open', 'instructor': 'Staff', 'daytime': 'Tue : 07:00 PM-10:00 PM'}]|LEC
CMST365041[54521]|Graduate|Open|CMST36504|Tue Thu : 10:30 AM-11:50 AM|This course will focus on cinematographic representations of theatrical and other artistic practices, primarily exemplified by many of Ingmar Bergman's films (e.g. The Seventh Seal and Fanny and Alexander) but also in the work of other film-directors. It will explore historical and theoretical issues related to the mutual interactions between cinema and theatre also discussing cinematographic techniques in playwriting as exemplified in plays by Henrik Ibsen (e.g. Peer Gynt) and August Strindberg (e.g. A Dream Play and The Ghost Sonata). Throughout most of his creative career Bergman worked both in theatre and film and even if he is mostly known outside of Sweden as a film director, his theatrical career was as innovative. The work of the film-auteur and the theatre director are for Bergman closely connected, not only through the actors he worked with – during summers for the screen and during the theatre seasons in stage productions – but also through the choice of themes, which are often in direct dialogue with each other in the two media, generating complex meta-aesthetic, inter-medial discourses, depicting and problematizing the work and role of the artist in a broad range of social and ideological contexts.

The course will emphasize how students can use 16mm technology towards successful cinematography and image design (for use in both analog and digital postproduction scenarios) and how to develop their ideas towards constructing meaning through moving pictures. Through a series of group exercises, students will put their hands on equipment and solve technical and aesthetic problems, learning to operate and care for the 16mm Bolex film camera; prime lenses; Sekonic light meter; Sachtler tripod; and Arri light kit and accessories. For a final project, students will plan and produce footage for an individual or small group short film. The first half the class will be highly structured, with demonstrations, in-class shoots and lectures. As the semester continues, class time will open up to more of a workshop format to address the specific concerns and issues that arise in the production of the final projects.

CRES208021[42822]|Undergraduate|Closed|CRES20802|Mon Wed : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM|The second segment of the African Civilizations sequence uses anthropological perspectives to investigate colonial and postcolonial encounters in West and East Africa. The course objective is to show that while colonialism was brutal and oppressive, it was by no means a unidirectional process of domination in which Europeans plundered the African continent and enforced a wholesale adoption of European culture. Rather, scholars today recognize that colonial encounters were complex culture, political, and economic fields of interaction. Africans actively adopted, reworked, and contested colonizers' policies and projects, and Europeans drew heavily from these encounters to form liberal conceptions of self, nation, and society. Over the course of the quarter, students will learn about forms of personhood, political economy, and everyday life in the twentieth century. Course themes will include social reproduction, kinship practices, medicine, domesticity, and development.

CRES242121[55345]|Undergraduate|Open|CRES24212|Tue Thu : 04:30 PM-05:50 PM|In 1971, the writer Tomás Rivera described the “Chicano renaissance” as a process of self-invention that involved the “exteriorization of our will”—an effort that motivated a “life in search of form.” This course will examine some of the most ambitious works of literature that are the result of this search. Our guiding inquiries will be simultaneously interpretive, theoretical, and historical: What does it mean to think of form as an “exteriorization” of one’s “will”? Whose will do these forms represent (who is the “us” in Rivera’s “our will”)? What representational strategies enable this exteriorization and dramatize its limitations? Why was the novel so often singled out, and why did some feminist writers prefer instead a collection of letters, poems, journal entries, and personal essays? These questions will inform our study of the consolidation of a self-conscious Chicago literature and its attendant literary history. Students of the course will therefore not only become familiar with exciting works of textual art, they will also study the institutional context that enables the consolidation of “a literature,” and a “literary history.” Authors will include José Antonio Villarreal, Tomás Rivera, Rudolfo Anaya, Cherríe Moraga, Ana Castillo, and Gloria Anzaldúa.

CRES250111[55347]|Undergraduate|Closed|CRES25011|Mon Wed : 03:00 PM-04:20 PM|This MA/BA-level course introduces students to globalization theory, with particular attention to readings that showcase the displacements and migrations that characterize the era of advanced global capitalism. Fleeing economic, social, and climatological collapse, migrants hardly find a second home; they become refugees without refuge. The limits on their flourishing extend far beyond the national borders that they cross in search of livable life. Wherever they go, they are discriminated and psychologically segregated by discourses of race nationalism, discourses in which migrations give rise to races. This course will focus on this process of migrant racialization—all the more pressing in light of current world events—with a curriculum that includes works by Weber, Simmel, Smohalla, Benedict Anderson, Anzaldúa, Appadurai, Brathwaite, Walter Benjamin, Celan, Derrida, Eggers, Ghosh, Le Guin, Glissant, Vine Deloria Jr., Woody Guthrie, Mbembe, Haraway, Tsing, Giddens, Negri and Hardt, Jason Moore, Bhabha, August Wilson, Sterling Brown, Big Bill Broonzy, Jacob Lawrence, Miguel Méndez, Mary Louise Pratt, Momaday, Silko, Canclini, Karen Tei Yamashita, Heise, Gikandi, Schmidt-Camacho, Fields and Fields, Bonilla-Silva, and Massey, in addition to film screenings and field exercises.

Secondly, we will read texts about the post-apartheid period that illuminate the role of advertising in a context in which all have formal political equality, but unequal access to a consumer lifestyle. In most weeks of the course, During most weeks the first class of the week will consider texts that deal with advertising, consumption and race in the context under discussion and the second will engage with texts that lay out theoretical approaches to analyzing advertising, and we will use these to engage with actual examples of ads from the various time periods under discussion. In the last few weeks of the course, we will examine how the specific case of South Africa can elucidate the way linkages between race and consumer citizenship play out in the national context of the US, with its own history of articulation between consumption, politics, and social difference.|Mary Robertson|TBA|Race and Politics of Advertising in South Africa and Beyond|1|[53824]|[]|SEM

In referring to that history, we treat a variety of themes, including migration and its impact, the origins and effects of class stratification, the relation of culture and cultural endeavor to collective consciousness, the rise of institutionalized religions, facts and fictions of political empowerment, and the correspondence of Black lives and living to indices of city wellness (services, schools, safety, general civic feeling). This is a history class that situates itself within a robust interdisciplinary conversation. Students can expect to engage works of autobiography and poetry, sociology, documentary photography, and political science as well as more straightforward historical analysis. By the end of the class, students should have grounding in Black Chicago's history and an appreciation of how this history outlines and anticipates Black life and racial politics in the modern United States.|Adam Green|Harper Mem Library 140|Introduction to Black Chicago, 1893-2010|1|[42943]|[]|LEC

It begins with two basic premises: first, both the Japanese colonial authorities’ measures of repression, and the Korean responses to them, can be understood as noticeably more staunch and sophisticated when compared to any other region of the Empire; and second, the censorship practices in Korea offers itself as a case that is in itself an effective point of comparison to better understand other censorship operations in general and the impact of these operations across different regions. With a view to probing an inter- and intra-relationship between censorship practices among a variety of imperial/colonial regions, this course studies the institutions related to censorship, the human agents involved in censorship—both external and internal—and texts and translations that were produced in and outside of Korea, and were subject to censorship. Overall, the course stresses the importance of establishing a comparative understanding of the functions of censorship, and on the basis of this comparative thinking we will strive to conceptualize the characteristics of Japanese colonial censorship in Korea.|Kyeong-Hee Choi|Wieboldt Hall 301N|Censorship in East Asia:  The Case of Colonial Korea|1|[53788]|[]|SEM

Fleeing economic, social, and climatological collapse, migrants hardly find a second home; they become refugees without refuge. The limits on their flourishing extend far beyond the national borders that they cross in search of livable life. Wherever they go, they are discriminated and psychologically segregated by discourses of race nationalism, discourses in which migrations give rise to races. This course will focus on this process of migrant racialization—all the more pressing in light of current world events—with a curriculum that includes works by Weber, Simmel, Smohalla, Benedict Anderson, Anzaldúa, Appadurai, Brathwaite, Walter Benjamin, Celan, Derrida, Eggers, Ghosh, Le Guin, Glissant, Vine Deloria Jr., Woody Guthrie, Mbembe, Haraway, Tsing, Giddens, Negri and Hardt, Jason Moore, Bhabha, August Wilson, Sterling Brown, Big Bill Broonzy, Jacob Lawrence, Miguel Méndez, Mary Louise Pratt, Momaday, Silko, Canclini, Karen Tei Yamashita, Heise, Gikandi, Schmidt-Camacho, Fields and Fields, Bonilla-Silva, and Massey, in addition to film screenings and field exercises.

In referring to that history, we treat a variety of themes, including migration and its impact, the origins and effects of class stratification, the relation of culture and cultural endeavor to collective consciousness, the rise of institutionalized religions, facts and fictions of political empowerment, and the correspondence of Black lives and living to indices of city wellness (services, schools, safety, general civic feeling). This is a history class that situates itself within a robust interdisciplinary conversation. Students can expect to engage works of autobiography and poetry, sociology, documentary photography, and political science as well as more straightforward historical analysis. By the end of the class, students should have grounding in Black Chicago's history and an appreciation of how this history outlines and anticipates Black life and racial politics in the modern United States.|Adam Green|Harper Mem Library 140|Introduction to Black Chicago, 1893-2010|1|[42944]|[]|LEC

We will discuss inequalities in morbidity, mortality, and health behaviors of women, men, and transgendered individuals from different race, ethnic, and class backgrounds, and we will use sociological concepts, theories, and methods to understand why these differences appear. Finally, we will examine how medicine as an institution and medical practices as organizations sometimes contribute to and combat gender inequality in health.

From Grotius to Vitoria through Hobbes and Locke up to Mill and beyond, the one thing that modernity’s self-possessive subject cannot will to alienate, sell, or give away is himself. From this perspective, slavery can only be a relation of domination or as a vanishing moment before the enslaved contracts into servitude. In the process of installing this perspective, philosophical modernity foreclosed myriad philosophical and legal traditions of self-enslavement at the precise moment that slavery itself was generalized as the Atlantic world’s foundational mode of political and social relation. This course will explore how this philosophical bracketing of the problem of auto-enslavement enabled Atlantic modernity to bracket slavery itself as an exceptional, pathological condition; we will then explore how the philosophical coding of humans as free by anthropological default affected the social, legal, and political life of the actually enslaved. The first part of this course will track the impossibilization of auto-enslavement in early modern and Enlightenment philosophical texts on international law, political theory, Biblical hermeneutics, and abolitionism. In the second part of this course, we will examine black and white improvisations with the figure of the self-enslaving subject, reading slave narratives, legal texts and cases.|Christopher Taylor|Walker Museum 403|I'm a Slave for You|1|[55352]|[]|SEM

Horror stories, considered broadly, go about this estranging work in more concerted ways, luring their characters into zones of emotional and perceptual extremity, violence, and metaphysical dislocation. In this course, we will pinpoint techniques used by (mostly) contemporary writers to deliver shades of fear in narratives rich enough to reward multiple readings. We’ll examine ways writers have engaged the tropes familiar to horror—e.g., doppelgangers, paranoia, the uncanny, the proximity of evil—in stories with complex characters, immersive sensory worlds, realistic social milieux, and potent ideas. Special attention will be paid to the uses of voice, atmosphere, and narrative architecture. Readings may include Henry James, Paul Bowles, Angela Carter, Ian McEwan, Joyce Carol Oates, Alice Munro, William Gay, David Foster Wallace, Reynolds Price, Mary Gaitskill, Kevin Brockmeier, and Karen Russell.

Some fundamental questions will include: What are the variants of the image in poetry, and how do these variants create different stances in the poem? How does the image interface with formal attributes, such as sound, rhythm, and line breaks? Does a poetic image necessarily entail a representational mode of thinking, or are their variations that resist literary mimesis? Is abstraction really antithetical to the image, as is often assumed, or are there ways that, in poems, abstraction and imagery work in chorus? We will discuss radically different approaches to poetic image making (e.g. synesthetic, collaged, surrealist, eco-poetic, iterative, abstract, juxtapositional, absurdist, haiku, etc.) and the aesthetic effects and values that they entail. We will also compare poetry’s sensory images to select practices in music, painting, photography, and film. Workshop discussions will focus on sensory elements of students’ poems and the poem as an organ of perception and feelings. Readings may include work by Bernard Badiou, Charles Baudelaire, André Breton, Mark Doty, Ezra Pound, William Carlos Williams, H.D., Elizabeth Bishop, Jared Stanley, Mei Mei Berssenbrugge, Francis Ponge, and others.

Ideally, it will also refine you as a reader and a critic. We will approach every work of fiction we read, whether published or workshopped, from the writer’s perspective: in terms of form, character, and language, and how the writer succeeds, fails, or innovates in these areas. And since fiction, like any art, is essentially an expression of who we are and how we see the world, we will also begin developing our individual voices as writers. For the course, you will complete one full-length story, which you will present for class critique, and then write a significant revision of that story, which you will either present for a second workshop or turn into the instructor at the end of the quarter. The course will also include a series of writing exercises and readings in canonical and contemporary short fiction, all intended to stoke your creativity and illuminate the aesthetic traditions that inform your work.|William Boast|Midway Studios 102|Fundamentals of Fiction|1|[53598]|[]|SEM

This class will forgo the magic and concentrate on how a story is built: the architecture of structure, the mechanisms of character development, the fluid dynamics of dialogue. We’ll take a close look at some of the building blocks that make up fiction writing: character, dialogue, plot, point of view, and setting. We’ll also read and discuss a variety of short stories, always with an eye to craft and to what you, as writers, can steal for your own work. That’s right, steal. Much of this class is devoted to learning how to steal the tools of great fiction writing, then to using those tools to realize your own vision. You’ll write extensively in and out of class, from weekly reading responses to writing exercises that build toward a polished piece of work. Finally, you will write a complete draft and one extensive revision of a short story or novel chapter. The last third of the class will be devoted to student workshops, where each student will turn in a draft of a story or chapter to be read and critiqued by the whole class.|Baird Harper|Midway Studios 108|Fundamentals of Fiction: CW Track|1|[53601]|[]|SEM

It will expose students to ways that poets have both employed and resisted patterns in meter, line, and rhyme, and it will ask students to experiment with constraints as a way of playing with formal limitations in their own poems. Students will also explore innovations in diction, syntax, and voice, and apply what they learn from these investigations in workshop discussions.

In this advanced workshop class, we’ll discuss the genre of young adult literature through evaluation of your own writing: what are its defining characteristics, and what’s the difference between writing for a young adult audience versus writing books and stories about teenagers but designed for adult readers? Students should be working on book-length projects involving teenaged protagonists, no matter the intended audience; please come to the first session with either work to submit or a sense of when you’d be able to sign up for a slot. We’ll spend most of our time evaluating student work, learning how to become both generous and rigorous critics, and we’ll also talk about the books that influenced us the most as young adult readers and the books we’re reading today, from contemporary writers like John Green and Rainbow Rowell to classic authors like S.E. Hinton and Madeleine L’Engle. Students will read at least one or two novels during the quarter as well. Instructor consent required. Submit writing sample via www.creativewriting.uchicago.edu.

CRWR320201[53609]|Graduate|Open|CRWR32020|Thu : 03:00 PM-05:50 PM|Fiction has many strategies for defamiliarizing the familiar, for destabilizing the ways we habitually think and feel about ourselves and our realities. Horror stories, considered broadly, go about this estranging work in more concerted ways, luring their characters into zones of emotional and perceptual extremity, violence, and metaphysical dislocation. In this course, we will pinpoint techniques used by (mostly) contemporary writers to deliver shades of fear in narratives rich enough to reward multiple readings. We’ll examine ways writers have engaged the tropes familiar to horror—e.g., doppelgangers, paranoia, the uncanny, the proximity of evil—in stories with complex characters, immersive sensory worlds, realistic social milieux, and potent ideas. Special attention will be paid to the uses of voice, atmosphere, and narrative architecture. Readings may include Henry James, Paul Bowles, Angela Carter, Ian McEwan, Joyce Carol Oates, Alice Munro, William Gay, David Foster Wallace, Reynolds Price, Mary Gaitskill, Kevin Brockmeier, and Karen Russell.

CRWR330171[53615]|Graduate|Open|CRWR33017|Thu : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|In this special topics course we will investigate and experiment with various approaches to imagery. Some fundamental questions will include: What are the variants of the image in poetry, and how do these variants create different stances in the poem? How does the image interface with formal attributes, such as sound, rhythm, and line breaks? Does a poetic image necessarily entail a representational mode of thinking, or are their variations that resist literary mimesis? Is abstraction really antithetical to the image, as is often assumed, or are there ways that, in poems, abstraction and imagery work in chorus? We will discuss radically different approaches to poetic image making (e.g. synesthetic, collaged, surrealist, eco-poetic, iterative, abstract, juxtapositional, absurdist, haiku, etc.) and the aesthetic effects and values that they entail. We will also compare poetry’s sensory images to select practices in music, painting, photography, and film. Workshop discussions will focus on sensory elements of students’ poems and the poem as an organ of perception and feelings. Readings may include work by Bernard Badiou, Charles Baudelaire, André Breton, Mark Doty, Ezra Pound, William Carlos Williams, H.D., Elizabeth Bishop, Jared Stanley, Mei Mei Berssenbrugge, Francis Ponge, and others. Students should plan to submit a poem a week, write a short craft essay, serve once as a discussion leader, comment on peers’ work, and participate in workshops.|Nathan Hoks|TBA|Special Topics in Poetry: Image, Perception, Sense|1|[53615]|[]|SEM

CRWR415011[53619]|Graduate|Open|CRWR41501|Wed : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|The current dominance of English makes it hard for English speakers to see the work translators do in making possible the worldwide circulation of ideas and forms. By some reports, the share of translated works in US publishing amounts to no more than five percent of new books. Yet theoretical and empirical studies of translation are on the rise, particularly in places where English is one of several linguistic options. This course will offer opportunities to think through both the theory and practice of this art form and means of cultural transmission, focusing on the problems of translation of and by poets in a variety of languages: it will emphasize precisely the genre most easily “lost in translation,” as the truism goes. It will offer students a chance to try their hands at a range of tactics of translation. Invited speakers with expertise in different languages and methods of translation will supplement our group readings in such authors as Dante, Petrarch, Chaucer, Wyatt, Shelley, Paz, Weinberger, Benjamin, Venuti, Celan, De Campos, Zukofsky, Erin Mouré, Etel Adnan, Anne Carson, and John Cayley.|Jennifer Scappettone|Logan Center 802|Advanced Translation Workshop: Found in Translation|1|[53619]|[]|SEM

While primarily a workshop, we will also be tracing some of the historical roots of the short story, starting with 19th-century ""tales"" by the likes of Flaubert and Gogol. As we move into the 20th century, we'll read Sherwood Anderson and James Joyce, classic Saturday Evening Post stories by O. Henry and F. Scott Fitzgerald, New Yorker writers like Dorothy Parker and Renata Adler, and also take a brief look at the 1960s/70s avant-garde. We’ll also look at contemporary writers like Lydia Davis and Kelly Link who draw on, respectively, essayistic and Gothic traditions. In our discussions, you will develop a broader, more nuanced understanding of the theories and techniques underpinning fiction writing and work to open up your aesthetic interests.

Our primary texts come from popular culture, film, visual art, and literature, which have provided lightning rods for controversy and protest in this charged climate. This course investigates the fraught relationship between marginal expressions of gender and sexuality on the one hand, and society’s notions of security and safety on the other. Whose safety matters? How do women and other minorities use artistic production, within and alongside the realm of popular culture, to advocate for their own conceptions of safety and what it might mean? From the erotic performance of feminine agency found in soft-core pornographic pink films, to the slippage between fantasy and reality found in the staged violence of women’s pro-wrestling, to the eco-feminism of activist Ishimure Michiko, and beyond, this course will explore the state of gender, femininity, and sexual politics in Japan, from the 1960s on into the present day.|Marianne Tarcov|TBA|Gender, Sexuality, Security Culture, and Protest in Post 3-11 Japan|1|[53654]|[{'sectionname': 'Section 1S01 [53655] - SCR Open', 'instructor': 'Staff', 'daytime': 'Wed : 07:00 PM-10:00 PM'}]|LEC
EALC220241[53662]|Undergraduate|Open|EALC22024|Tue Thu : 12:00 PM-01:20 PM|This course explores the shifting forms of Japanese mystery fiction and the functions the mystery genre has served both within modern Japanese literature and in Japanese mass culture as a whole. On the one hand, mystery writing in Japanese has proven to be a resilient and popular brand of “low” culture, often excluded from the realm of “pure” literature due to its focus on violence, lawlessness, and perversity. On the other, the treatment of these recurring themes according to established “rules” of the mystery genre has helped promote the creation of a reading public that shares a set of taboos and mores. Meanwhile, the problems tackled incisively by Japanese mystery works are often reflections of the larger societal problems posed by their time—including Westernization, imperial expansion, defeat in the Second World War, the arrival of economic prosperity, the collapse of the bubble economy, political corruption, and a perception of decline in the cohesiveness of community. Through examining mysteries, we will hope to arrive at a better understanding of how Japanese literature and society speak to and alter one another. Course materials include short stories, novels, and film from the 1920s to the present day by such writers and directors as Edogawa Rampo, Matsumoto Seicho, Miyabe Miyuki, Tanizaki Jun’ichiro, Kirino Natsuo, Kurosawa Akira, and Ichikawa Kon.

It begins with two basic premises: first, both the Japanese colonial authorities’ measures of repression, and the Korean responses to them, can be understood as noticeably more staunch and sophisticated when compared to any other region of the Empire; and second, the censorship practices in Korea offers itself as a case that is in itself an effective point of comparison to better understand other censorship operations in general and the impact of these operations across different regions. With a view to probing an inter- and intra-relationship between censorship practices among a variety of imperial/colonial regions, this course studies the institutions related to censorship, the human agents involved in censorship—both external and internal—and texts and translations that were produced in and outside of Korea, and were subject to censorship. Overall, the course stresses the importance of establishing a comparative understanding of the functions of censorship, and on the basis of this comparative thinking we will strive to conceptualize the characteristics of Japanese colonial censorship in Korea.|Kyeong-Hee Choi|Wieboldt Hall 301N|Censorship in East Asia:  The Case of Colonial Korea|1|[53789]|[]|SEM

We will study how Kurosawa’s turn to literary adaptation provided a vehicle for circumventing social taboos of his time and offered a screen for addressing politically sensitive and sometimes censored topics of Japan’s militarist past, war crimes, defeat in the Second World War, and ideological conflicts of reconstruction. The course combines film analysis with close reading of relevant literary sources, contextualized by current work of political, economic, and cultural historians of postwar Japan.

Nor, despite long-standing stereotypes to the contrary, has it only been the privilege of the elites to disrupt the traditional male-female binary. Readings will address such themes as the ways in which gender defines patterns in family life, in politics and under the law; marriage and homosexuality; prostitution and trafficking; performance and cross dressing; the implementation of the one child policy; gender roles in minority communities; and China's handling of HIV/AIDS.

EALC280151[53791]|Undergraduate|Open|EALC28015|Wed : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|“Bronze Age” in China conventionally refers to the time period from ca. 2000 BC to about 500 BC, during which bronze, an alloy of copper and other metals such as tin and lead, was the predominant medium used by the society, or to be more precise, the elite classes of the society. Bronze objects, in the forms of vessels, weapons, and musical instruments, were reserved for the upper ruling class of the society and were used mostly as paraphernalia during rituals and feasting. “Bronze Age” in China also indicates the emergence and eventual maturation of states with their bureaucratic systems, the presence of urban centers, a sophisticated writing system, and advanced craft producing industries, especially metal production. This course surveys the important archaeological finds of Bronze Age China and the theoretical issues such as state formation, craft production, writing, bureaucratic systems, urbanization, warfare, and inter-regional interaction, etc. It emphasizes a multi-disciplinary approach with readings and examples from anthropology, archaeology, art history, and epigraphy.

Unlike an isolated female portrait or an individual female symbol, a feminine space is a spatial entity: an artificial world composed of landscape, vegetation, architecture, atmosphere, climate, color, fragrance, light, and sound, as well as selected human occupants and their activities. This course traces the construction of this space in traditional Chinese art (from the second to the eighteenth centuries) and the social/political implications of this constructive process.|Hung-Wu Wu|Cochrane-Woods Art Ctr 152|Feminine Space in Chinese Art|1|[54527]|[]|SEM

In addition to reading selections from masterpieces of Chinese dramatic literature such as Orphan of Zhao, Romance of the Western Chamber, The Peony Pavilion, we will pay particular attention to the different types of venues, occasions, and performance practices associated with different genres of opera at different moments in time. A central theme will be the changing status of the entertainer and the cultural meanings assigned to acting.

Focusing on masterworks such as the Tale of Genji, Miraculous Origins of Mt.

It begins with two basic premises: first, both the Japanese colonial authorities’ measures of repression, and the Korean responses to them, can be understood as noticeably more staunch and sophisticated when compared to any other region of the Empire; and second, the censorship practices in Korea offers itself as a case that is in itself an effective point of comparison to better understand other censorship operations in general and the impact of these operations across different regions. With a view to probing an inter- and intra-relationship between censorship practices among a variety of imperial/colonial regions, this course studies the institutions related to censorship, the human agents involved in censorship—both external and internal—and texts and translations that were produced in and outside of Korea, and were subject to censorship. Overall, the course stresses the importance of establishing a comparative understanding of the functions of censorship, and on the basis of this comparative thinking we will strive to conceptualize the characteristics of Japanese colonial censorship in Korea.|Kyeong-Hee Choi|Wieboldt Hall 301N|Censorship in East Asia:  The Case of Colonial Korea|1|[53787]|[]|SEM

EALC4336401[54757]|Graduate|Open|EALC43364|Tue : 09:45 AM-11:45 AM|The purpose of this course is to enhance the students’ understanding of the application of law and legal theory through study of the growing body of legal texts from pre-imperial and early imperial China. In addition to situating the Chinese legal materials in their varying legal, social, political, cultural and historical contexts, and thereby highlighting some of their unique elements, the course also familiarizes students with a wide range of theoretical materials (eg., anthropological, legal philosophical, economic, etc.) which may be useful in bringing to light any universalities of legal systems and behavior. However, discussion of any given text will be directed in large part by the nature and contents of the material itself. The Chinese materials, all readings of which will be in translation, range from commemorative inscriptions cast in bronze sacral vessels and descriptions of legal practices in received texts, to actual statutes and case records, philosophical texts and legal debates. The medium, discovery/transmission, and authorship of each document will be given due consideration for the effect they may have on our understanding of the contemporary legal context from which the text derives. The course culminates with student presentations on the material of their choice. Preparation for presentations will be conducted in consult with the instructor. Students are encouraged to draw from their study of other legal systems and/or systems of legal thought (both modern and pre-modern) in their discussion of the ancient Chinese material. It is hoped that the course will help students question their own assumptions about legal behavior, and the nature and role of law and legal systems in early China, specifically, and within the human world, generally. Students in Humanities/Social Sciences may apply to take this course.|Laura Skosey|Laird Bell Quadrangle E|Legal History of Early China|01|[54757]|[]|CRS

EALC480151[53794]|Graduate|Open|EALC48015|Wed : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|“Bronze Age” in China conventionally refers to the time period from ca. 2000 BC to about 500 BC, during which bronze, an alloy of copper and other metals such as tin and lead, was the predominant medium used by the society, or to be more precise, the elite classes of the society. Bronze objects, in the forms of vessels, weapons, and musical instruments, were reserved for the upper ruling class of the society and were used mostly as paraphernalia during rituals and feasting. “Bronze Age” in China also indicates the emergence and eventual maturation of states with their bureaucratic systems, the presence of urban centers, a sophisticated writing system, and advanced craft producing industries, especially metal production. This course surveys the important archaeological finds of Bronze Age China and the theoretical issues such as state formation, craft production, writing, bureaucratic systems, urbanization, warfare, and inter-regional interaction, etc. It emphasizes a multi-disciplinary approach with readings and examples from anthropology, archaeology, art history, and epigraphy. This course will also visit the Smart Museum, the Field Museum, and the Art Institute of Chicago to take advantage of the local collections of ancient Chinese arts and archaeology.|Yung-Ti Li|Regenstein Library 420|Archaeology of Bronze Age China|1|[53794]|[]|SEM

ECON190001[44158]|Undergraduate|Open|ECON19000|Tue Thu : 12:00 PM-01:20 PM|The field of economics has generated a powerful set of insights which have fundamentally shaped the modern world. Because modern economics puts such a heavy stress on mathematical rigor, the most interesting economic ideas often get pushed to the background. In this course, we will explore these big economic ideas, without the math. Our goal is to make the beauty and power of economic thinking available to everyone. We will discuss what it means to think like an economist, how you can use economic thinking to make the world a better place (or to take advantage of your friends and enemies, if you prefer), and also how sometimes thinking like an economist can get you into trouble.|Steven Levitt, John List|Kent Chem Lab 107|Economics for Everyone|1|[44158]|[{'sectionname': 'Section 1D01 [44159] - DIS Open', 'instructor': 'Staff', 'daytime': 'Mon : 06:00 PM-06:50 PM'}]|LEC

Some hypotheses to be considered are the q-theory of housing investment, the neoclassical approach to fiscal policy, and whether government spending has a “multiplier.” The course confronts several empirical issues that are also encountered outside the field of macroeconomics such as the construction of aggregate data, choice of data set, and the measurement of expectations.|Robert Shimer|Saieh Hall for Economics 021|Theory of Income-3|1|[44166]|[{'sectionname': 'Section 1D01 [44167] - DIS Open', 'instructor': 'Staff', 'daytime': 'Fri : 10:30 AM-11:50 AM'}]|LEC

As such, the course will include topics ranging from social networks to social capital to discrimination. We will examine the effects of social interactions on individual and aggregate behaviors as well as the implications of social interactions for the formation of social structure. Particular attention will be given to the translation of theoretical models into econometric analogs and to the identification questions that arise when attempting to construct empirical evidence on social interactions. Applications of social interactions will focus on contexts in which their presence can help explain observed levels of socioeconomic inequality.|Steven Durlauf|Saieh Hall for Economics 103|Social Interactions and Inequality|1|[43766]|[{'sectionname': 'Section 1D01 [43767] - DIS Open', 'instructor': 'Staff', 'daytime': 'Thu : 04:00 PM-04:50 PM'}]|LEC

ENGL104501[43718]|Undergraduate|Open|ENGL10450|Tue Thu : 03:00 PM-04:20 PM|This course will trace the historical course of English poetry through one genre, that of elegy. From Ben Jonson to John Milton, from P. B.

ENGL178181[42900]|Undergraduate|Open|ENGL17818|Mon Wed : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM|In American popular culture, the eighteenth century is remembered today (to the extent that it is remembered at all) as a heady time of revolutions and revolutionaries, when towering figures of the Enlightenment established modern democracy. This, in many ways, reflects the narrative eighteenth-century writers were developing about their own age. For British Whigs, the “Glorious Revolution” of 1688 had been a watershed moment at which the arbitrary rule of kings had been replaced for all time by constitutionalism; the social contract and the civil polity had triumphed over divine-right ideology, ushering in a new, beneficent era of progress. And, in the 1790s, the French Revolution fired the political imaginations of British radicals who saw the potential for a world made anew – a world of universal suffrage and gender equality, where slavery was abolished. Clearly, attaining these goals was a long way off. The debates over the structures, meanings, and nature of consent had tendrils in multiple areas of society – the law, of course, but also in understandings of sexuality, constructions of gender, economics, and colonization. Questions of rights, agency, and authority (what those categories meant, who could possess them, and who guaranteed them) were by no means settled, and, indeed, throughout the century, calls to curtail the categories of people who should have access to the sphere of political influence were often as boisterous as those to expand such access. This course will explore how a range of authors in eighteenth-century Britain figured questions of consent, rights, and authority and how the ideological debates these authors mediated continue to inform contemporary politics, cultures, and identities. We will read works by literary figures such as Daniel Defoe, Samuel Richardson, Mary Hays, Olaudah Equiano, and Mary Shelley. We will consider the writings of some of the major political philosophers of the day, as well, including John Locke, Thomas Hobbes, Mary Astell, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Thomas Paine, and Mary Wollstonecraft. We will additionally discuss readings in modern criticism and theory to help us better situate our primary texts in the discourses of modernity and better understand their lasting resonances.|Tristan Schweiger|TBA|Consent and Coercion: Rights, Agency, and Authority in the Eighteenth Century and Beyond|1|[42900]|[]|SEM

We then consider imperial debates over taxation in the 1760s and 1770s, returning Benjamin Franklin’s Autobiography to its original context. Reading Paine’s Common Sense and the letters of Abigail Adams and John Adams we look at the multiple meanings of independence. We study Jefferson’s drafting process, read the Declaration over the shoulders of people on both sides of the Atlantic, and consider clues to contemporary meanings beyond the intentions of Congress.

ENGL210061[42360]|Undergraduate|Open|ENGL21006|Mon Wed : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM|Course centers on Joseph Conrad’s The Secret Agent: A Simple Tale. Contemporary critics often consider this novel the archetypal fictional work about terrorism, as it is based on the bomb attack that occurred in Greenwich in 1888. The Secret Agent demonstrates, however, much more than its prophetic significance rediscovered after 9/11. Therefore, the course seeks how the novel’s relevance stems in equal measure from Conrad’s interest in a wider political process and his distrust of state power; in particular, the course explores how these forces determine the individual caught in a confining situation. We read The Secret Agent as a political novel, that struggle for solutions defies chaos as well as an imposition of a single ideology or one authorial point of view. Its ambiguities and political antinomies allow for interdisciplinary readings that also present an opportunity to critically overview the established approaches to main Conradian themes. In analyzing the formation of the narrative’s ideology we discuss Conrad’s historical pessimism that demonstrates with sustained irony how capitalism breeds social injustice that, in turn, breeds anarchism. The class also focuses on how the novel exposes duplicity in staging surveillance, terrorism, as well as adjacent forms of violence or sacrifice. Critical texts include several older but still influential readings (Jameson, Eagleton) and the most recent.|Bozena Shallcross|TBA|Joseph Conrad's The Secret Agent: (In)action, Surveillance, Terrorism|1|[42360]|[]|LEC

Our guiding inquiries will be simultaneously interpretive, theoretical, and historical: What does it mean to think of form as an “exteriorization” of one’s “will”? Whose will do these forms represent (who is the “us” in Rivera’s “our will”)? What representational strategies enable this exteriorization and dramatize its limitations? Why was the novel so often singled out, and why did some feminist writers prefer instead a collection of letters, poems, journal entries, and personal essays? These questions will inform our study of the consolidation of a self-conscious Chicago literature and its attendant literary history. Students of the course will therefore not only become familiar with exciting works of textual art, they will also study the institutional context that enables the consolidation of “a literature,” and a “literary history.” Authors will include José Antonio Villarreal, Tomás Rivera, Rudolfo Anaya, Cherríe Moraga, Ana Castillo, and Gloria Anzaldúa.

Worrying ourselves into the realm of the pathological, we now have a requisite measure of anxiety for every prescribed stage of life. But why are we so anxious? Considering its prevalence in everyday life, the concept and theories of anxiety have been employed surprisingly seldom as a way into film, fiction, and art. In this course we examine the modern origin of contemporary discourses specific to anxiety and their unique manifestation in cultural artifacts. To understand the complex of anxiety in the so-called Western world, we rely on the theories of Søren Kierkegaard, Martin Heidegger, Sigmund Freud, Jacques Lacan, and Alenka Zupančič; fiction by Stoker, Schnitzler, Kafka, and Sebald; and film by Haneke, Kubrick, Ophuls, and Hitchcock.

Fleeing economic, social, and climatological collapse, migrants hardly find a second home; they become refugees without refuge. The limits on their flourishing extend far beyond the national borders that they cross in search of livable life. Wherever they go, they are discriminated and psychologically segregated by discourses of race nationalism, discourses in which migrations give rise to races. This course will focus on this process of migrant racialization—all the more pressing in light of current world events—with a curriculum that includes works by Weber, Simmel, Smohalla, Benedict Anderson, Anzaldúa, Appadurai, Brathwaite, Walter Benjamin, Celan, Derrida, Eggers, Ghosh, Le Guin, Glissant, Vine Deloria Jr., Woody Guthrie, Mbembe, Haraway, Tsing, Giddens, Negri and Hardt, Jason Moore, Bhabha, August Wilson, Sterling Brown, Big Bill Broonzy, Jacob Lawrence, Miguel Méndez, Mary Louise Pratt, Momaday, Silko, Canclini, Karen Tei Yamashita, Heise, Gikandi, Schmidt-Camacho, Fields and Fields, Bonilla-Silva, and Massey, in addition to film screenings and field exercises.

In this period of rapid urbanization and industrialization, writers explored how rapidly changing financial circumstances might change a person’s life. This course surveys major American novels from the late 19th and early 20th centuries to ask questions like: How does money articulate with social class in the context of American political ideology? How do writers represent the moral status and responsibilities of the wealthy as different from those of the poor?

This course explores the influence that the recording, editing, and exhibition of film had on the literary practices of Modernist writers. We will look at the fiction of such writers as Woolf, Joyce, and Elizabeth Bowen; and at Modernist writers’ essays on the medium. How did cinematic experiences of glamor, temporality, anonymity, and technology affect the experiments of writers who wanted to innovate their own medium? How can the emergence of cinema help us think about literary Modernism's approach to narrative and subjectivity? (G)|Sophia Withers|TBA|Literary Modernism and the Cinema|1|[43762]|[]|SEM

We begin by surveying the development and trajectory of the field, particularly as it develops around debates on revolution and compromise, cosmopolitanism, the psychology of colonialism, and anti-colonial historiography. Alongside this, we consider the recent disciplinary revival of the categories of “global Anglophone” and “world literature” through readings on “literary worlds” to to evaluate these categories, and their contributions to ongoing debates about translation/translatability, vernaculars, rewriting, and mimicry. What are the claims made on behalf of literary texts in orienting us to other lives and possibilities, and in registering the experience of geographic and cultural displacement? To better answer this, we read recent scholarship that engages the field in conversations around intimacy, belonging, and human rights, to think about the impulses that animate the field, and its possible futures. Readings will likely include works by Debjani Ganguly, Kamau Brathwaite, Jean Rhys, Amitava Kumar, Sara Ahmed and Amitav Ghosh.|Darrel Chia|TBA|Postcolonial Openings|1|[54369]|[]|SEM

ENGL310061[42361]|Graduate|Open|ENGL31006|Mon Wed : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM|Course centers on Joseph Conrad’s The Secret Agent: A Simple Tale. Contemporary critics often consider this novel the archetypal fictional work about terrorism, as it is based on the bomb attack that occurred in Greenwich in 1888. The Secret Agent demonstrates, however, much more than its prophetic significance rediscovered after 9/11. Therefore, the course seeks how the novel’s relevance stems in equal measure from Conrad’s interest in a wider political process and his distrust of state power; in particular, the course explores how these forces determine the individual caught in a confining situation. We read The Secret Agent as a political novel, that struggle for solutions defies chaos as well as an imposition of a single ideology or one authorial point of view. Its ambiguities and political antinomies allow for interdisciplinary readings that also present an opportunity to critically overview the established approaches to main Conradian themes. In analyzing the formation of the narrative’s ideology we discuss Conrad’s historical pessimism that demonstrates with sustained irony how capitalism breeds social injustice that, in turn, breeds anarchism. The class also focuses on how the novel exposes duplicity in staging surveillance, terrorism, as well as adjacent forms of violence or sacrifice. Critical texts include several older but still influential readings (Jameson, Eagleton) and the most recent.|Bozena Shallcross|TBA|Joseph Conrad's The Secret Agent: (In)action, Surveillance, Terrorism|1|[42361]|[]|LEC

Fleeing economic, social, and climatological collapse, migrants hardly find a second home; they become refugees without refuge. The limits on their flourishing extend far beyond the national borders that they cross in search of livable life. Wherever they go, they are discriminated and psychologically segregated by discourses of race nationalism, discourses in which migrations give rise to races. This course will focus on this process of migrant racialization—all the more pressing in light of current world events—with a curriculum that includes works by Weber, Simmel, Smohalla, Benedict Anderson, Anzaldúa, Appadurai, Brathwaite, Walter Benjamin, Celan, Derrida, Eggers, Ghosh, Le Guin, Glissant, Vine Deloria Jr., Woody Guthrie, Mbembe, Haraway, Tsing, Giddens, Negri and Hardt, Jason Moore, Bhabha, August Wilson, Sterling Brown, Big Bill Broonzy, Jacob Lawrence, Miguel Méndez, Mary Louise Pratt, Momaday, Silko, Canclini, Karen Tei Yamashita, Heise, Gikandi, Schmidt-Camacho, Fields and Fields, Bonilla-Silva, and Massey, in addition to film screenings and field exercises.

Data suggests a rapidly growing divergence between those earners at the bottom and those at the top. This course seeks to place that current concern in conversation with a range of moments in nineteenth and twentieth century history when literature and economics converged on questions of economic inequality. In keeping with recent political economic scholarship by Thomas Piketty, we will be adopting a long historic view and a somewhat wide geographic scale as we explore how economic inequality is represented, measured, assessed, and addressed. Readings will include some of the following literature: Hard Times, Le Pere Goriot, The Jungle, The Time Machine, Native Son, Landscape for a Good Woman, White Tiger; and some of the following economic and political texts: Principles of Political Economy, The Acquisitive Society, The Theory of the Leisure Class, Capital (Marx and Piketty), The Price of Inequality, and Inequality Re-examined.

ENGL378181[42901]|Graduate|Open|ENGL37818|Mon Wed : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM|In American popular culture, the eighteenth century is remembered today (to the extent that it is remembered at all) as a heady time of revolutions and revolutionaries, when towering figures of the Enlightenment established modern democracy. This, in many ways, reflects the narrative eighteenth-century writers were developing about their own age. For British Whigs, the “Glorious Revolution” of 1688 had been a watershed moment at which the arbitrary rule of kings had been replaced for all time by constitutionalism; the social contract and the civil polity had triumphed over divine-right ideology, ushering in a new, beneficent era of progress. And, in the 1790s, the French Revolution fired the political imaginations of British radicals who saw the potential for a world made anew – a world of universal suffrage and gender equality, where slavery was abolished. Clearly, attaining these goals was a long way off. The debates over the structures, meanings, and nature of consent had tendrils in multiple areas of society – the law, of course, but also in understandings of sexuality, constructions of gender, economics, and colonization. Questions of rights, agency, and authority (what those categories meant, who could possess them, and who guaranteed them) were by no means settled, and, indeed, throughout the century, calls to curtail the categories of people who should have access to the sphere of political influence were often as boisterous as those to expand such access. This course will explore how a range of authors in eighteenth-century Britain figured questions of consent, rights, and authority and how the ideological debates these authors mediated continue to inform contemporary politics, cultures, and identities. We will read works by literary figures such as Daniel Defoe, Samuel Richardson, Mary Hays, Olaudah Equiano, and Mary Shelley. We will consider the writings of some of the major political philosophers of the day, as well, including John Locke, Thomas Hobbes, Mary Astell, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Thomas Paine, and Mary Wollstonecraft. We will additionally discuss readings in modern criticism and theory to help us better situate our primary texts in the discourses of modernity and better understand their lasting resonances.|Tristan Schweiger|TBA|Consent and Coercion: Rights, Agency, and Authority in the Eighteenth Century and Beyond|1|[42901]|[]|SEM

Taking works by Charlotte and Emily Brontë, Charles Dickens, Henry Mayhew, Thomas Hardy, and Henry James as our principle points of departure, our course will pursue the “Victorian unconscious” through three lines of questioning: First, we will ask how Victorian literature anticipated the development of psychoanalytic concepts, such as the unconscious, repression, infantile sexuality and the symptom. At the same time, we will question whether Freud’s reflections on the psychopathologies of modern culture can in fact help to explain specific structural and social transformations in the 19th century public sphere, like the construction of modern sewer systems, the legal regulation of sexual acts, or the development of obscenity law. Finally, we will interrogate how the unconscious operates as a site of theoretical interest within Marxist and postcolonial critiques of modern imperialism. Our readings of 19th century novels will be complemented by extensive readings in psychoanalytic theory (Freud, Klein, Lacan, Winnicott) and pre-pscyhoanalytic psychiatry (e.g. Esquirol, Tuke, Krafft-Ebing, Charcot, Cotard), as well as relevant works by theorists elaborating and questioning psychoanalytic insights, including George Batailles, Michel Foucault, Jacques Rancière, Frederic Jameson, Edward Said, Kaja Silverman, Lauren Berlant, Eve Kosofsky Sed|Zachary Samalin|Rosenwald Hall 405|The Victorian Unconscious|1|[41087]|[]|SEM

This class will read science fiction, feminist theory and current critical work that concerns itself with bios, biology and biopolitics in order to ask questions about the divide between nature and culture, what’s entailed in imagining the future, what gender and genre have to do with each other, and just what science fiction is and does anyway.

ENGL553001[41089]|Graduate|Open|ENGL55300|Thu : 03:00 PM-05:50 PM|This course will trace the philosophical, juridical, and literary itinerary of modernity’s impossible subject: the person who enslaves himself. From Grotius to Vitoria through Hobbes and Locke up to Mill and beyond, the one thing that modernity’s self-possessive subject cannot will to alienate, sell, or give away is himself. From this perspective, slavery can only be a relation of domination or as a vanishing moment before the enslaved contracts into servitude. In the process of installing this perspective, philosophical modernity foreclosed myriad philosophical and legal traditions of self-enslavement at the precise moment that slavery itself was generalized as the Atlantic world’s foundational mode of political and social relation. This course will explore how this philosophical bracketing of the problem of auto-enslavement enabled Atlantic modernity to bracket slavery itself as an exceptional, pathological condition; we will then explore how the philosophical coding of humans as free by anthropological default affected the social, legal, and political life of the actually enslaved. The first part of this course will track the impossibilization of auto-enslavement in early modern and Enlightenment philosophical texts on international law, political theory, Biblical hermeneutics, and abolitionism. In the second part of this course, we will examine black and white improvisations with the figure of the self-enslaving subject, reading slave narratives, legal texts and cases.|Christopher Taylor|Walker Museum 403|I'm a Slave for You|1|[41089]|[]|SEM

While in an age of global migrations, multilingual speakers have come to outnumber the number of monolingual speakers, literary studies continue to privilege works aimed at a monolingual audience. This is particularly the case in the United States, where “English-only” attitudes have dominated discourse for over a century. This course instead explores literary works that take up residence in the space between two or more languages, whether national or regional—as well as those that attempt to dodge semantic systems altogether. From modernist collage and transense to contemporary poetry of exile, migration, and diaspora, the works we will study, lodged between tongues, lend nuance and fascination to debates surrounding “global literature” and untranslatability. We will examine the formal and social prompts and repercussions of experiments in polylingualism, barbarism, dialect, creole, and thwarted translation, and will delve into examples of the potential for mixed/new media poetics to accommodate multiple linguistic systems. While it is not at all necessary for students to be fluent in more than one language to take this course, some experience learning or attempting to learn languages beyond English is essential.

We also discuss the physics and economics of the resulting human energy system: fuel sources and relationship to energy flows in the Earth system; and modeling and simulation of energy production and use. Our goal is to provide a technical foundation for students interested in careers in the energy industry or in energy policy. Field trips required to major energy converters (e.g., coal-fired and nuclear power plants, oil refinery, biogas digester) and users (e.g., steel, fertilizer production).|Elisabeth Moyer|TBA|Energy:  Science, Technology and Human Usage|1|[42122]|[]|LEC

The course will explore the ways in which biological processes affect the environment and how the evolutionary trajectories of organisms have in turn been influenced by environmental change. In order to reconstruct the history of these processes, we will examine the imprints they leave on both the rock record and on the genomic makeup of living organisms. The metabolism and evolution of microorganisms, and the biogeochemistry they drive, will be a major emphasis.|Maureen Coleman, Jacob Waldbauer|Hinds Lab Geo Sci 184|Geobiology|1|[42347]|[]|LEC

Drawing sociological theories of labor and consumption, class, and capitalism into popular notions of taste, nutrition, and the “good farmer,” this course aims to answer questions of agrofood systems in a globalizing world. We will bring social scientific theory to bear on a series of case studies centering on the United States and its relationships with other places. Our driving questions and interdisciplinary readings will be animated by four themes: 1) ideological roots of food and farming, 2) causes and consequences of agricultural globalization, 3) challenges facing urban and rural food access, and 4) power dynamics of sustainable land use.|Amanda Lequieu|TBA|Eating a Global Environment: Critical Perspectives of Agrofood Systems|1|[58362]|[]|SEM

We will present the major components of these strategies as found in several asset classes (equities, futures, credit, FX, interest rates and energy). A large proportion of the models involved in quantitative strategies are expressible in terms of regressions. We will cover most of the ways they are used, including practical tricks and considerations, and concentrating particularly on achieving trustworthy performance. Mathematically, we will cover the computation of linear regressions with and without weights, in univariate and multivariate cases, having least squares or other objective functions. Of the major computation technologies actively used by the finance industry (C/C++, Matlab, Java, R, VB/Excel, C\#, Python) we have chosen R and Python for numerical computation, with (very) light usage of Excel and with data coming from Quandl and some proprietary sources.|Brian Boonstra|5727 S.

FNDL210061[42362]|Undergraduate|Open|FNDL21006|Mon Wed : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM|Course centers on Joseph Conrad’s The Secret Agent: A Simple Tale. Contemporary critics often consider this novel the archetypal fictional work about terrorism, as it is based on the bomb attack that occurred in Greenwich in 1888. The Secret Agent demonstrates, however, much more than its prophetic significance rediscovered after 9/11. Therefore, the course seeks how the novel’s relevance stems in equal measure from Conrad’s interest in a wider political process and his distrust of state power; in particular, the course explores how these forces determine the individual caught in a confining situation. We read The Secret Agent as a political novel, that struggle for solutions defies chaos as well as an imposition of a single ideology or one authorial point of view. Its ambiguities and political antinomies allow for interdisciplinary readings that also present an opportunity to critically overview the established approaches to main Conradian themes. In analyzing the formation of the narrative’s ideology we discuss Conrad’s historical pessimism that demonstrates with sustained irony how capitalism breeds social injustice that, in turn, breeds anarchism.

Boccaccio’s Decameron, written in the midst of the social disruption caused by the Black Death (1348), may have held readers attention for centuries because of its bawdiness, but it is also a profound exploration into the basis of faith and the meaning of death, the status of language, the construction of social hierarchy and social order, and the nature of crisis and historical change. Framed by a story telling contest between seven young ladies and three young men who have left the city to avoid the plague, the one hundred stories of the Decameron form a structural masterpiece that anticipates Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales, the Renaissance epics, and the modern short story. We will especially focus on how the work explores the intersection of legal and literary representation but students will be encouraged to further explore in individual projects the many topics raised by the text, including (and in addition to the themes mentioned above) magic, the visual arts, mercantile culture, travel and discovery, and new religious practices.|Justin Steinberg|TBA|Boccaccio's Decameron|1|[54801]|[]|SEM

The course will be organized around an intensive engagement with two central texts: Herodotus’ Histories and Thucydides’ History of the Peloponnesian War. As we read through these works, we will also take up the wider historical and political context—e.g., the fifth-century rise of Athenian democracy and imperialism—and the relationship between our texts and other genres, including philosophy, drama, and rhetoric. The aim of the course is not only to give students a close familiarity with our two authors and some of the scholarship surrounding them, but also, more broadly, to think through the relationship between political theory and history. How might political theory guide the writing of history, and how can history contribute to theorizing politics?

This erudite Polish author is a prime 20th century modernist whose novels, entangled in an ongoing battle with fundamental questions and, indeed, with existence itself, explode with uncanny laughter. In contrast to many of his contemporary writers who established their reputation by applying existing philosophical models, Gombrowicz employed ironically his philosophical erudition, while engaging in his philosophical récit the literary and cultural tropes which derived from his Polish cultural heritage. Over the next ten weeks, we will investigate how he twisted these references and tropes to inform a distinctly Gombrowiczian version of performative philosophy. We will read Gombrowicz’s novels, lectures on philosophy and some of his autobiographical writings to seek answers to our overarching question: what makes this author a philosopher?|Bozena Shallcross|Foster Hall 408|Gombrowicz: The Writer as Philosopher|1|[42356]|[]|LEC

Originally published in 1943, it is one of Strauss’s most intransigent essays.

While our study will broadly proceed by way of a study of techniques such as collage, montage, and photomontage; the diagram, the readymade, and appropriation; realism and materiality; and event-based and urban-geographical strategies, we will also engage several philosophical texts on the subject, namely, Jacques Rancière's The Politics of Aesthetics. Consequently, our study will advance a discussion about the dialectical relationship between ""form"" and ""aesthetics,"" while we will also interrogate the evolution of ""politcial subjectivity"" and its modes of being and expression in twentieth-century film, art, and life. Additionally, this seminar is designed to coincide with and compliment the yearlong project ""Concrete Happenings"" in the Department of Art History, and the associated symposium on ""Fluxus and Film"" that will take place in the spring term."|Jennifer Wild|Cobb Hall 310|The Form of Politics/The Politics of Form|1|[43977]|[{'sectionname': 'Section 1S01 [43978] - SCR Open', 'instructor': 'Staff', 'daytime': 'Mon : 10:30 AM-01:20 PM'}]|SEM

GEOG402171[42094]|Graduate|Open|GEOG40217|Mon Wed : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM|This course covers statistical and econometric methods specifically geared to the problems of spatial dependence and spatial heterogeneity in cross-sectional data. The main objective of the course is to gain insight into the scope of spatial regression methods, to be able to apply them in an empirical setting, and to properly interpret the results of spatial regression analysis. While the focus is on spatial aspects, the types of methods covered have general validity in statistical practice. The course covers the specification of spatial regression models in order to incorporate spatial dependence and spatial heterogeneity, as well as different estimation methods and specification tests to detect the presence of spatial autocorrelation and spatial heterogeneity. Special attention is paid to the application to spatial models of generic statistical paradigms, such as Maximum Likelihood, Generalized Methods of Moments and the Bayesian perspective. An important aspect of the course is the application of open source software tools such as R, GeoDa and PySal to solve empirical problems.|Luc Anselin|TBA|Spatial Regression Analysis|1|[42094]|[]|LEC

GLST241051[43387]|Undergraduate|Closed|GLST24105|Mon Wed : 10:30 AM-11:50 AM|Where is the Middle East, how do we go about studying it and why does it matter? This course explores the emergence of the 'Middle East' as an object of inquiry; a place with a people and a culture set in opposition to the 'West'. It asks how these categories are constituted, by whom, and with what consequence. How do they define the contours of political community, the possibilities for empathy and understanding or the limits of rights and moral obligation? The historical and contemporary texts assigned draw attention to the layered and shifting meanings of these categories, and in turn to the geopolitical and epistomological worlds that give rise to them. By putting these texts into conversation with each other the course engages a number of key issues that have occupied social theorists: the relationship between power and knowledge, the politics of representation, and the nature of social theory more generally.|Yaqub Hilal|TBA|Rethinking the Middle East|1|[43387]|[]|SEM

It will examine the construction of a new scientific ‘narrative’ that formulated new standards by redrawing boundaries of scientific definition. We will particularly focus on the occult sciences (astrology, physiognomy, alchemy), which lost their scientific status and were relegated to the level of pseudo-sciences. A closer look into the redrawing of scientific boundaries to exclude the occult sciences and redefine other sciences will allow us to pose larger questions about scientific epistemologies.|Emin Lelic|TBA|Science: From the Occult to the Enlightenment|1|[54994]|[]|SEM

Our primary texts come from popular culture, film, visual art, and literature, which have provided lightning rods for controversy and protest in this charged climate. This course investigates the fraught relationship between marginal expressions of gender and sexuality on the one hand, and society’s notions of security and safety on the other. Whose safety matters? How do women and other minorities use artistic production, within and alongside the realm of popular culture, to advocate for their own conceptions of safety and what it might mean? From the erotic performance of feminine agency found in soft-core pornographic pink films, to the slippage between fantasy and reality found in the staged violence of women’s pro-wrestling, to the eco-feminism of activist Ishimure Michiko, and beyond, this course will explore the state of gender, femininity, and sexual politics in Japan, from the 1960s on into the present day.|Marianne Tarcov|TBA|Gender, Sexuality, Security Culture, and Protest in Post 3-11 Japan|1|[53658]|[{'sectionname': 'Section 1S01 [53659] - SCR Open', 'instructor': 'Staff', 'daytime': 'Wed : 07:00 PM-10:00 PM'}]|LEC

This course incorporates readings from history, anthropology and political science, and focuses on case studies from the entire continent from colonization in the late 19th century to the present. The course highlights numerous themes pertinent to the study of gender and sexuality, such as: (a) the intersections of, sexuality, race, class, and other identities; (b) gendered constructions of power and gendered power; (c) women’s “domestic” roles; and (d) the effects of migration, urbanization, and globalization on sex and sexuality.|Elizabeth Fretwell|TBA|Gender and Sexuality in Africa|1|[53831]|[]|SEM

Because one way to respond to this question looks disciplinary and methodological, this class will be structured around how “queer theory” (broadly defined) has been differently distributed and taken up by various fields of inquiry and, as such, will invite guest speakers from across the Social Sciences and Humanities to lead discussions on how their fields have encountered the materials, conversations, and questions raised by queer theory.|Omiela Hsu|5733 S.

Nor, despite long-standing stereotypes to the contrary, has it only been the privilege of the elites to disrupt the traditional male-female binary. Readings will address such themes as the ways in which gender defines patterns in family life, in politics and under the law; marriage and homosexuality; prostitution and trafficking; performance and cross dressing; the implementation of the one child policy; gender roles in minority communities; and China's handling of HIV/AIDS. We will consider the role of old Confucian hierarchies and scrutinize the links between industrialization, women's liberation, nationalism, and the communist movement.

Taking works by Charlotte and Emily Brontë, Charles Dickens, Henry Mayhew, Thomas Hardy, and Henry James as our principle points of departure, our course will pursue the “Victorian unconscious” through three lines of questioning: First, we will ask how Victorian literature anticipated the development of psychoanalytic concepts, such as the unconscious, repression, infantile sexuality and the symptom. At the same time, we will question whether Freud’s reflections on the psychopathologies of modern culture can in fact help to explain specific structural and social transformations in the 19th century public sphere, like the construction of modern sewer systems, the legal regulation of sexual acts, or the development of obscenity law. Finally, we will interrogate how the unconscious operates as a site of theoretical interest within Marxist and postcolonial critiques of modern imperialism. Our readings of 19th century novels will be complemented by extensive readings in psychoanalytic theory (Freud, Klein, Lacan, Winnicott) and pre-pscyhoanalytic psychiatry (e.g. Esquirol, Tuke, Krafft-Ebing, Charcot, Cotard), as well as relevant works by theorists elaborating and questioning psychoanalytic insights, including George Batailles, Michel Foucault, Jacques Rancière, Frederic Jameson, Edward Said, Kaja Silverman, Lauren Berlant, Eve Kosofsky Sed|Zachary Samalin|Rosenwald Hall 405|The Victorian Unconscious|1|[55344]|[]|SEM

GRMN237151[54491]|Undergraduate|Open|GRMN23715|Tue Thu : 03:30 PM-04:50 PM|Berlin at the turn of the 19th century was the epicenter of Germany’s rapid urbanization and industrialization, and as such it became a privileged site for observing and experiencing modernity. One of the most prominent features of life in the modern metropolis, as noted by contemporaries, was its fragmentary character, both in social terms—the atomization of society as a whole—and in mental terms—the psychic instability of the atomized individual. This course explores a variety of critical and artistic responses to fragmentation: critical efforts to render the fragmented urban landscape legible, and literary and other artistic efforts to explore the potentialities of fragmentation through innovative forms and techniques. The main part of the course will focus on the Weimar period: literature, film and criticism of the Golden Twenties. Afterwards we will turn to short fiction, poetry, and film of post-unification Berlin. Authors include Carl Sternheim, Walter Benjamin, Siegfried Kracauer, Joseph Roth, Alfred Döblin, Georg Heym, Jacob von Hoddis, Alfred Lichtenstein, Gottfried Benn, Bertolt Brecht, Durs Grünbein, and Tanja Dückers.

Mann began the novel under the Weimar Republic and continued working on the novel in exile. The writer himself saw his novel as an act of resistance to his country’s anti-Semitic policies. In this course, we will closely read the novel, explore its relation to its biblical and other sources, learn about the history of its writing and publication and contextualize its genesis in Mann’s complicated involvement with German and world politics.|Olga Solovieva|Cobb Hall 303|Thomas Mann's Joseph and His Brothers|1|[54350]|[]|SEM

Worrying ourselves into the realm of the pathological, we now have a requisite measure of anxiety for every prescribed stage of life. But why are we so anxious? Considering its prevalence in everyday life, the concept and theories of anxiety have been employed surprisingly seldom as a way into film, fiction, and art. In this course we examine the modern origin of contemporary discourses specific to anxiety and their unique manifestation in cultural artifacts. To understand the complex of anxiety in the so-called Western world, we rely on the theories of Søren Kierkegaard, Martin Heidegger, Sigmund Freud, Jacques Lacan, and Alenka Zupančič; fiction by Stoker, Schnitzler, Kafka, and Sebald; and film by Haneke, Kubrick, Ophuls, and Hitchcock.

And given the fact that his work so often deals, if only indirectly, with the Holocaust and its aftershocks, his work has furthermore been associated with that highly problematic generic and historical constellation, “Holocaust literature.” The seminar will address all of Sebald’s major works in the hope of elucidating this singular intersection of historical and literary complexity.|Eric L Santner|Wieboldt Hall 206|W.G.

The aim of the course is to follow the development of Christian thought by relating its structural features to the historical context in which they arose without adhering to schematic models such as East vs. West, orthodoxy vs. heresy, Alexandrian vs. Antiochene exegesis. The following authors and themes will be analysed and discussed: 1. Martyrdom and the Authority of Christian Witness: Ignatius of Antioch, Justin Martyr 2. Platonism and Exegesis: Philo and Origen 3. Incarnation and Asceticism: Athanasius, Gregory of Nyssa 4. Ecclesial Unity and Episcopal Authority: Cyprian, Ambrose and Chrysostom 5. Projecting Historical Authority: Eusebius and Jerome 6.

This course will focus on a number of medieval women writers, dealing mainly albeit not exclusively with vernacular texts. After a historical overview of the position of women in the early Middle Ages, the course will focus on Heloise and Hildegard of Bingen as transitional figures, and continue with four women writers writing in the vernacular, i.e., Mechtild of Magdeburg, Hadewijch, Marguerite Porete and Julian of Norwich. The course will link the spectrum of vernacular languages which they represent to the diversity of their individual positions and analyze that diversity in terms of ecclesiastical developments, gender division, authorial identity, and theological criticism. The final aim is to come to an assessment of the constructive contribution of these vernacular treatises to the tradition of late medieval theology and spirituality|Willemien Otten|Swift Hall 208|Late Medieval Women: Authorship and Authority|1|[41261]|[]|LEC

Until today the appropriation of Byzantine style is especially evident in the church of Saint Mark the Evangelist, as well as in the decoration of less-well known medieval churches of the Venetian Lagoon. During the so-called Fourth Crusade, the Sack of Constantinople has led to large-scale pillaging of the Byzantine capital and the transfer to Venice of countless Byzantine artifacts, among them are liturgical items, reliquaries, icons, and architectural spoils. How were these artifacts employed in the Venetian Lagoon for religious and political ends after being disassociated from their original contexts? What transformations did they experience with regard to usage and appearance? What kinds of new ceremonies, both religious and secular, did they inspire? What was their impact on artistic creativity and religious life in their new environment? How were they perceived intellectually, and what kinds of narratives evolved around them in Venice over the centuries? These are some of the key questions to guide our research. On a broader scale, we will investigate various phenomena of cultural transfer and ‘hybridity’ from the Middle Ages to the Baroque era.|Karin Krause|Swift Hall 201|Between East and West: Venice in the Pre-Modern Period|1|[41405]|[]|SEM

Students will examine the theoretical and methodological groundings of cultural psychiatry, examining how scholars working in the phenomenological tradition have tried to describe the lived experiences of various forms of “psychopathology” or “madness.” By the end of the course, students will have learned how to describe and analyze the social dimension of a mental health experience, using a phenomenologically-grounded anthropological approach, and by adopting a technical vocabulary for understanding the lived experiences of mental illness (for instance, phenomena, life-world, being-in-the-world, intentionality, epoché, embodiment, madness, psychopathology, melancholia/depression, schizophrenia, etc). In addition, given the ongoing problematic of “how to represent mental illness,” students will also have the opportunity to think through the different ways of presenting their analysis, both in the form of weekly blog entries and during a final-week mock-workshop, where they will showcase their work in a creative medium appropriate to that analysis.|Francis McKay|Saieh Hall for Economics 247|Experiencing Madness: Empathic Methods in Cultural Psychiatry|1|[53675]|[]|SEM

First, science has been the subject of artistic representation, in painting and photography, in poetry and novels (e.g., in Byron’s poetry, for example). Second, science has been used to explain aesthetic effects (e.g., Helmholtz’s work on the way painters achieve visual effects or musicians achieve tonal effects). Third, aesthetic means have been used to convey scientific conceptions (e.g., through illustrations in scientific volumes or through aesthetically affective and effective writing). Finally, philosophers have stepped back to consider the relationship between scientific knowing and aesthetic comprehension (e.g., Kant, Bas van Fraassen); much of the discussion of this latter will focus on the relation between images and what they represent. In this lecture-discussion course we will consider all of these aspects of the science-aesthetic connection.|Robert Richards|TBA|Science and Aesthetics in the 18th-21st Centuries|1|[42920]|[]|SEM

Historians have often relegated Iberia and its New World domains from accounts of the developments of modern science. They have traditionally claimed that strict censorship and a commitment to orthodox Catholicism prevented Spain, once the most powerful empire of the world, from embarking on the path towards scientific modernity in the eighteenth century. Modern scholars, however, have challenged this narrative by embracing more inclusive concepts of ""science"" to explain the many ways in which early modern people related to nature. Some of these practices include the writing of natural histories, botanical research, and linguistic studies, all fields that Iberian scholars pioneered in their efforts to govern their vast domains.

How did these scientists build relationships with the various governments? What were their reactions to the various forms of government (i.e. democracy vs. fascist dictatorship vs. 'real existing socialism')?

The course objective is to show that while colonialism was brutal and oppressive, it was by no means a unidirectional process of domination in which Europeans plundered the African continent and enforced a wholesale adoption of European culture. Rather, scholars today recognize that colonial encounters were complex culture, political, and economic fields of interaction. Africans actively adopted, reworked, and contested colonizers' policies and projects, and Europeans drew heavily from these encounters to form liberal conceptions of self, nation, and society. Over the course of the quarter, students will learn about forms of personhood, political economy, and everyday life in the twentieth century. Course themes will include social reproduction, kinship practices, medicine, domesticity, and development.

Employing insights from gender history, postcolonial studies and feminist theory, we look at a broad range of historical case studies to explore themes such as the intersectionality of race, class and gender; the instability of gender ideologies; how power was articulated through the fields of gender and sexuality; the politics of intimacy; and the regulation and ‘improvement’ of colonial bodies. Our goal is to better understand the ways that gender/sexuality and Western imperialism were co-constitutive in specific imperial and colonial contexts.|Darcy Heuring|Saieh Hall for Economics 247|Gender, Sex, and Empire|1|[53321]|[]|SEM

Making extensive use of Jewish law and customary practice, cookbooks, etiquette guides, prints, films, novels, maps, memoirs, architectural drawings and photographs, and tourist guides, this course will analyze how Jews (in all their diversity) and non-Jews defined Jewish spaces and places. The focus will be on Europe in the 19th and 20th centuries, but we will also venture back into the early modern period and across the Mediterranean to Palestine/Israel and North Africa, and across the Atlantic to the Caribbean and the Americas. We will study both actually existing structures—synagogues, ritual baths, schools, kosher (and kosher-style) butcher shops, bakeries and restaurants, social and political clubs, hospitals, orphanages, old age homes, museums, and memorials—but also texts and visual culture in which Jewish places and spaces are imagined or vilified. Parallel to our work with primary sources we will read in the recent, very rich, scholarly literature on this topic. This is not a survey course; we will undertake a series of intensive case-studies through which we will address the larger issues. This is a limited-enrollment, discussion-based course in which both undergraduates and graduate students are welcome.

In this course we try to understand these emotional attachments by examining the narrative of loss and redemption through which most nations in the Balkans retell their Ottoman past. We begin by considering the mythic temporality of the Romantic national narrative while focusing on specific national literary texts where the national past is retold through the formula of original wholeness, foreign invasion, Passion, and Salvation. We then proceed to unpack the structural role of the different elements of that narrative. With the help of Žižek’s theory of the subject as constituted by trauma, we think about the national fixation on the trauma of loss, and the role of trauma in the formation of national consciousness. Specific theme inquiries involve the figure of the Janissary as self and other, brotherhood and fratricide, and the writing of the national trauma on the individual physical body. Special attention is given to the general aesthetic of victimhood, the casting of the victimized national self as the object of the “other’s perverse desire.” With the help of Freud, Žižek, and Kant we consider the transformation of national victimhood into the sublimity of the national self. The main primary texts include Petar Njegoš’ Mountain Wreath (Serbia and Montenegro), Ismail Kadare’s The Castle (Albania), Anton Donchev’s Time of Parting (Bulgaria).|Angelina Ilieva|Stuart Hall 104|The Burden of History: The Nation and Its Lost Paradise|1|[42376]|[]|LEC

""Modern"" in the context of this course signifies a period in which China faced radical new paradigms for the role of sex and the meaning of gender. Although much that we will read describes the twentieth century, we will also discover that innovations in gender roles are not unique to the past hundred years. Nor, despite long-standing stereotypes to the contrary, has it only been the privilege of the elites to disrupt the traditional male-female binary. Readings will address such themes as the ways in which gender defines patterns in family life, in politics and under the law; marriage and homosexuality; prostitution and trafficking; performance and cross dressing; the implementation of the one child policy; gender roles in minority communities; and China's handling of HIV/AIDS. We will consider the role of old Confucian hierarchies and scrutinize the links between industrialization, women's liberation, nationalism, and the communist movement.

With a slight emphasis on the natural sciences--but broadening out our view when necessary--we will examine how German scientists chose to interact with six (or seven, depending on how you count) Germanys--the German Empire (1871-1918), the Weimar Republic (1919-1933), the Third Reich (1933-1945), occupied Germany (1945-1949), West and East Germany (1949-1990), and the reunified Germany of today (1990-present). How did these scientists build relationships with the various governments? What were their reactions to the various forms of government (i.e. democracy vs. fascist dictatorship vs. 'real existing socialism')? How did emerging concepts of ethics in science play into scientists' relations with the political sphere?

First, science has been the subject of artistic representation, in painting and photography, in poetry and novels (e.g., in Byron’s poetry, for example). Second, science has been used to explain aesthetic effects (e.g., Helmholtz’s work on the way painters achieve visual effects or musicians achieve tonal effects). Third, aesthetic means have been used to convey scientific conceptions (e.g., through illustrations in scientific volumes or through aesthetically affective and effective writing). Finally, philosophers have stepped back to consider the relationship between scientific knowing and aesthetic comprehension (e.g., Kant, Bas van Fraassen); much of the discussion of this latter will focus on the relation between images and what they represent.

HIST261171[41613]|Undergraduate|Open|HIST26117|Tue Thu : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM|“Progress,” and its derived concept of “development” have puzzled Latin Americans throughout their modern history: they were an ambitious goal and a challenge for intellectual and political elites, a reality and an elusive dream for ordinary Latin Americans, and the cause of new challenges and problems wherever they actually or presumably took place. For historians, progress and development used to represent the very sense of universal history, a narrative that sneaked into visions of “Western modernity” and “globalization.” But later on, they became a myth to debunk rather than an object of reflection. What has “progress” meant particularly for Latin Americans? What is, for instance, the meaning of “progress” in the Brazilian flag? How did those notions shape the one of “development” since WWII? In political terms, what ideas of “progress” and “development” animated oligarchic, liberal, populist, military, revolutionary, and democratic projects across the region? Because both concepts involve planning and envisioning the outcome of present actions, the history of progress and development is also, in a certain way, a history of the future. The goal of this seminar is to help students situate a problem of their choice and trace its history in terms of the political debates that pursued the goal of progress and development in that specific realm.|Pablo Palomino|Psychology K114|Progress and Development in Latin America|1|[41613]|[]|LEC

Historians have often relegated Iberia and its New World domains from accounts of the developments of modern science. They have traditionally claimed that strict censorship and a commitment to orthodox Catholicism prevented Spain, once the most powerful empire of the world, from embarking on the path towards scientific modernity in the eighteenth century. Modern scholars, however, have challenged this narrative by embracing more inclusive concepts of ""science"" to explain the many ways in which early modern people related to nature. Some of these practices include the writing of natural histories, botanical research, and linguistic studies, all fields that Iberian scholars pioneered in their efforts to govern their vast domains. This course will introduce students to a diversity of scientific practices that flourished in the Hispanic world between 1400 and 1800."|Valeria Lopez Fadul|TBA|Nature, Science, and Empire in the Early Modern Iberian World, 1400-1800|1|[42927]|[]|SEM

This course will examine this three-hundred-year history by investigating the following essential questions: (1) How did a collection of diverse kingdoms manage to create a global empire? (2) What specific factors can explain the Spanish decline of the seventeenth century? (3) Was the Spanish Empire doomed to fail from the very beginning? (4) Why did many colonial subjects remain loyal to Spain after the Conquest and especially after a century of decline? (5) Why did the empire collapse only after 1808? In our exploration of these questions, we will pay particular attention to Spain's ambitious and pioneering, if also destructive, involvement with conquest, colonial exploitation, chattel slavery, racial domination, and a mission to ""civilize"" the world. We will then proceed to investigate the Spanish decline of the seventeenth century and the influence of the emerging empires of Britain, France, and the Dutch Republic. The course concludes by examining Spain's effort to reform its empire during the eighteenth century, interrogating whether this effort alienated Spanish colonial subjects and ultimately contributed to the dissolution of the empire."|Fidel Tavarez|TBA|The Rise and Fall of the Spanish Empire|1|[42930]|[]|SEM

Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings is one of the most popular works of imaginative literature of the twentieth century. This course seeks to understand its appeal by situating Tolkien's creation within the context of Tolkien's own work as both artist and scholar and alongside its medieval sources and modern parallels. Themes to be addressed include the problem of genre and the uses of tradition; the nature of history and its relationship to place; the activity of creation and its relationship to language, beauty, evil, and power; the role of monsters in imagination and criticism; the twinned challenges of death and immortality, fate and free will; and the interaction between the world of ""faerie"" and religious belief."|Rachel Fulton|Harper Mem Library 140|Tolkien: Medieval & Modern|1|[42963]|[]|LEC

Many of the chief theoretical concerns of the Intelligentsia (the role of the public intellectual in society, the expression of dissidence and the ethics of exile) have preoccupied thinkers since Socrates. What distinguishes the Intelligentsia from other models of public intellectualism? How have various Slavic public intellectuals maintained, or broken with, this tradition? In order to establish a theoretical vocabulary, the course will begin with an introduction to several classical and contemporary theories of the role of the intellectual in society. We will then ground our inquiry in the historical invention of the Russian Intelligentsia during the mid-19th Century before setting off to analyze its 20th and 21st-century manifestations. Throughout the course, our main goal will be to examine the ways in which these thinkers conceive of and perform the role of a “public intellectual.” How do they balance the tasks of documenting and participating in the historical events they describe? What strategies do they utilize in order to relay their intellectual activity to a larger public? What do they consider to be the responsibility of intellectuals?|Kaitlyn Tucker|TBA|The Intelligentsia:  On Slavic Social Thought|1|[54336]|[]|LEC

In this course we try to understand these emotional attachments by examining the narrative of loss and redemption through which most nations in the Balkans retell their Ottoman past. We begin by considering the mythic temporality of the Romantic national narrative while focusing on specific national literary texts where the national past is retold through the formula of original wholeness, foreign invasion, Passion, and Salvation. We then proceed to unpack the structural role of the different elements of that narrative. With the help of Žižek’s theory of the subject as constituted by trauma, we think about the national fixation on the trauma of loss, and the role of trauma in the formation of national consciousness. Specific theme inquiries involve the figure of the Janissary as self and other, brotherhood and fratricide, and the writing of the national trauma on the individual physical body. Special attention is given to the general aesthetic of victimhood, the casting of the victimized national self as the object of the “other’s perverse desire.” With the help of Freud, Žižek, and Kant we consider the transformation of national victimhood into the sublimity of the national self. The main primary texts include Petar Njegoš’ Mountain Wreath (Serbia and Montenegro), Ismail Kadare’s The Castle (Albania), Anton Donchev’s Time of Parting (Bulgaria).|Angelina Ilieva|Stuart Hall 104|The Burden of History: The Nation and Its Lost Paradise|1|[42377]|[]|LEC

""Modern"" in the context of this course signifies a period in which China faced radical new paradigms for the role of sex and the meaning of gender. Although much that we will read describes the twentieth century, we will also discover that innovations in gender roles are not unique to the past hundred years. Nor, despite long-standing stereotypes to the contrary, has it only been the privilege of the elites to disrupt the traditional male-female binary. Readings will address such themes as the ways in which gender defines patterns in family life, in politics and under the law; marriage and homosexuality; prostitution and trafficking; performance and cross dressing; the implementation of the one child policy; gender roles in minority communities; and China's handling of HIV/AIDS. We will consider the role of old Confucian hierarchies and scrutinize the links between industrialization, women's liberation, nationalism, and the communist movement.

First, science has been the subject of artistic representation, in painting and photography, in poetry and novels (e.g., in Byron’s poetry, for example). Second, science has been used to explain aesthetic effects (e.g., Helmholtz’s work on the way painters achieve visual effects or musicians achieve tonal effects). Third, aesthetic means have been used to convey scientific conceptions (e.g., through illustrations in scientific volumes or through aesthetically affective and effective writing). Finally, philosophers have stepped back to consider the relationship between scientific knowing and aesthetic comprehension (e.g., Kant, Bas van Fraassen); much of the discussion of this latter will focus on the relation between images and what they represent.

Readings will include a series of theoretical works in combination with articles and monographs, to provide a broader underpinning for the problems of perception and historical analysis at play in this realm of scholarly thought and practice."|Amy Lippert|TBA|Visual Culture in American Life, 1800-1915|1|[54214]|[]|SEM
HIST628051[42974]|Graduate|Closed|HIST62805|Mon : 12:30 PM-03:20 PM|This course explores the burgeoning historiography of American conservatism, tracing the movement from its grassroots origins after World War II to its institutionalization and militarization in the Reagan era to the rise of evangelicalism and Tea Party politics. We will focus on the role of women in the movement, the ideological alliances in its founding, and the roles of particular conservative groups in the movement's history. This course will move both chronologically and thematically to explore fundamental questions about activism and radicalization, grassroots and top-down ideologies, and the impact of conservative thought and institutions upon American society and state in the late twentieth century.|Kathleen Belew|Cobb Hall 107|Colloquium: American Conservatism, 1945–Present|1|[42974]|[]|SEM
HIST642021[43843]|Graduate|Open|HIST64202|Wed : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|"How do we know what we know about ancient religions? Historians of religion often begin by turning to texts: either sacred texts, or, in the absence of such scriptures, descriptions of belief and practice by observers from outside the faith. Archaeologists focus their attention on the spaces and traces of religious practice—or at least those that survive—while art historians begin by examining images of deities and religious rites. Yet we often fail to see the extent to which the questions which we ask of all of these diverse sources are conditioned by Christian rhetoric about pagan worship. In this course, we compare two moments when Christians encountered ""pagans"": during the initial Christian construction of a discourse on paganism (and, more broadly, a discourse on religion) during the late Roman empire and during the Spanish discovery of the New World. Our course examines silences and absences in the textual and material records, as well as the divergences between texts and objects, in order to further our understanding of ancient religious practice. We will begin to see the many ways in which, as scholars of religion, we are in effect still Christian theologians, paving the way for new approaches to the study of ancient religion."|Clifford Ando, Claudia Brittenham|Regenstein Library 207|The Discovery of Paganism|1|[43843]|[]|SEM
HIST646081[42978]|Graduate|Open|HIST64608|Wed : 03:00 PM-05:50 PM|This course will continue an intensive examination of central aspects of Karl Marx's mature social theory. A prerequisite for the course is familiarity with the first volume of Capital in this sequence. Following a brief review of central aspects of the first two volumes, we will focus on a close reading of the third volume of Capital. Those texts will be approached as an attempt to formulate a critical and reflexive theory that would be adequate to the character and dynamic of modern social life.|Moishe M Postone|Social Sciences Rsch Bldg 302|Colloquium:  Marx VIII|1|[42978]|[]|SEM

After several weeks spent reading recent interventions on the topic, students will work in groups of three or four on projects that will culminate in the production of a blog, website, exhibition, script for tour guides, prose for visitors' guides, catalog, curricular initiative, YouTube video, or short film (among other options). Students will also be expected to develop potential clients for their product. Technical assistance will be provided.|Leora Auslander|TBA|Broadening Horizons Graduate Colloquium|1|[42981]|[]|SEM
HIST699001[42982]|Graduate|Closed|HIST69900|Mon : 09:30 AM-12:20 PM|This course is designed as a forum to grasp intellectual issues across the historical discipline and balance the tendency towards specialization in the profession. While the course may be most helpful for graduate students in history early in their career, it is also open to more senior students and those interested in history outside the department. A ten-week course can hardly do justice to debates on the nature of history and the nuances of writing history. Thus this course is selective by necessity. The class is basically structured around discussion of the assigned materials, but each session will be introduced by a short lecture.|Jane Dailey, Mauricio Tenorio|TBA|Coll: Historiography|1|[42982]|[]|SEM

We begin with a consideration of the English Revolution, investigating the texts of the Declaration of Rights of 1689 and Locke’s Second Treatise and their meanings to American revolutionaries. We then consider imperial debates over taxation in the 1760s and 1770s, returning Benjamin Franklin’s Autobiography to its original context. Reading Paine’s Common Sense and the letters of Abigail Adams and John Adams we look at the multiple meanings of independence. We study Jefferson’s drafting process, read the Declaration over the shoulders of people on both sides of the Atlantic, and consider clues to contemporary meanings beyond the intentions of Congress. Finally, we briefly engage the post-revolutionary history of the place and meaning of the Declaration in American life. (F)|Eric Slauter|TBA|The Declaration of Independence|1|[43740]|[]|SEM

HREL403011[43844]|Graduate|Open|HREL40301|Wed : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|"How do we know what we know about ancient religions? Historians of religion often begin by turning to texts: either sacred texts, or, in the absence of such scriptures, descriptions of belief and practice by observers from outside the faith. Archaeologists focus their attention on the spaces and traces of religious practice—or at least those that survive—while art historians begin by examining images of deities and religious rites. Yet we often fail to see the extent to which the questions which we ask of all of these diverse sources are conditioned by Christian rhetoric about pagan worship. In this course, we compare two moments when Christians encountered ""pagans"": during the initial Christian construction of a discourse on paganism (and, more broadly, a discourse on religion) during the late Roman empire and during the Spanish discovery of the New World. Our course examines silences and absences in the textual and material records, as well as the divergences between texts and objects, in order to further our understanding of ancient religious practice. We will begin to see the many ways in which, as scholars of religion, we are in effect still Christian theologians, paving the way for new approaches to the study of ancient religion."|Clifford Ando, Claudia Brittenham|Regenstein Library 207|The Discovery of Paganism|1|[43844]|[]|SEM

While wisdom has received less scholarly attention in modern times, it has recently re-emerged in popular discourse with a growing recognition of its potential importance for addressing complex issues in many domains. But what is wisdom? It’s often used with a meaning more akin to ""smart"" or ""clever."" Is it just vast knowledge? This course will examine the nature of wisdom—how it has been defined, how its meaning has changed, and what its essential components might be. We will examine how current psychological theories conceptualize wisdom and consider whether, and how, wisdom can be studied scientifically; that is, can wisdom be measured and experimentally manipulated to illuminate its underlying mechanisms and understand its functions? Finally, we will explore how concepts of wisdom can be applied in business, education, medicine, the law, and in the course of our everyday lives. Readings will be drawn from a wide array of disciplines including philosophy, classics, history, psychology, behavioral economics, medicine, and public policy."|W.

First, students will replace purely metaphorical (and vague) talk of networks with focused propositions about the network properties and dynamics of contemporary phenomena such as international hierarchy, regional fragmentation amidst global integration, and the fate of sovereign territoriality in an age of (violent) transnational activism. Second, students will ponder competing explanations of the network turn in IPE: have IPE scholars abandoned conventional analytical tools in favor of network theory, because the conventional toolkit already came with rudimentary network-theoretic devices that simply needed sharpening; or did some changes in the real international economy prompt the shift? Finally, students will critically assess the ability of SNT to be a vehicle for innovative social science. They will do this, in part, by devising a research proposal of their own that assesses the validity and utility of testing a single network-theoretic proposition against some conventional competitor.|Matthias Staisch|Saieh Hall for Economics 242|Network Theory for International Political Economy|1|[41845]|[]|SEM

It took European romanticism by storm and has recently become a canonical form in English poetry. This class traces the development of the Persian ghazal from Jami (d. 1492) through the 20th century, examining the Realist School poets (Maktab-e voqu`), the Fresh Style (Tazeh-gu), neo-Classical style, and modernist ghazal poets, examining questions of lyric form, traditional conventions and their adaptation, complexity, the ethics of defeatism, gendering of the form and the breakdown of traditional lyrical form into ""ghazal-like"" poems (ghazalvaareh), with a special focus on Vahshi, Sa'eb, Bidel, Hazin, Zib al-Nesa, Qorrat al-`Ayn, Iqbal, Simin-e Behbehani."|Franklin Lewis|TBA|Persian Lyric Poetry-2: History of the Ghazal|1|[54873]|[]|SEM

This course is designed to explore the history and structural dynamics of Jewish, Christian, and Islamic mysticisms through the careful reading of primary sources across the traditions.|Michael Fishbane, Bernard Mcginn, Michael Sells|Swift Hall 400|Comparative Issues in Monotheistic Mystical Traditions|1|[58361]|[]|SEM

Making extensive use of Jewish law and customary practice, cookbooks, etiquette guides, prints, films, novels, maps, memoirs, architectural drawings and photographs, and tourist guides, this course will analyze how Jews (in all their diversity) and non-Jews defined Jewish spaces and places. The focus will be on Europe in the 19th and 20th centuries, but we will also venture back into the early modern period and across the Mediterranean to Palestine/Israel and North Africa, and across the Atlantic to the Caribbean and the Americas. We will study both actually existing structures—synagogues, ritual baths, schools, kosher (and kosher-style) butcher shops, bakeries and restaurants, social and political clubs, hospitals, orphanages, old age homes, museums, and memorials—but also texts and visual culture in which Jewish places and spaces are imagined or vilified. Parallel to our work with primary sources we will read in the recent, very rich, scholarly literature on this topic. This is not a survey course; we will undertake a series of intensive case-studies through which we will address the larger issues.

KNOW214021[42922]|Undergraduate|Open|KNOW21402|Tue : 12:00 PM-02:50 PM|One can distinguish four ways in which science and aesthetics are related during the period since the Renaissance. First, science has been the subject of artistic representation, in painting and photography, in poetry and novels (e.g., in Byron’s poetry, for example). Second, science has been used to explain aesthetic effects (e.g., Helmholtz’s work on the way painters achieve visual effects or musicians achieve tonal effects).

First, science has been the subject of artistic representation, in painting and photography, in poetry and novels (e.g., in Byron’s poetry, for example). Second, science has been used to explain aesthetic effects (e.g., Helmholtz’s work on the way painters achieve visual effects or musicians achieve tonal effects).

Historians of religion often begin by turning to texts: either sacred texts, or, in the absence of such scriptures, descriptions of belief and practice by observers from outside the faith. Archaeologists focus their attention on the spaces and traces of religious practice—or at least those that survive—while art historians begin by examining images of deities and religious rites. Yet we often fail to see the extent to which the questions which we ask of all of these diverse sources are conditioned by Christian rhetoric about pagan worship. In this course, we compare two moments when Christians encountered ""pagans"": during the initial Christian construction of a discourse on paganism (and, more broadly, a discourse on religion) during the late Roman empire and during the Spanish discovery of the New World. Our course examines silences and absences in the textual and material records, as well as the divergences between texts and objects, in order to further our understanding of ancient religious practice. We will begin to see the many ways in which, as scholars of religion, we are in effect still Christian theologians, paving the way for new approaches to the study of ancient religion."|Clifford Ando, Claudia Brittenham|Regenstein Library 207|The Discovery of Paganism|1|[43845]|[]|SEM

The New Latin American Cinema (NLAC) of the late 1950s-70s generated unprecedented international enthusiasm for Latin American film production. The filmmakers of this loosely designated movement were defining themselves in relation to global realist film traditions like Italian Neorealism and Griersonian documentary, in relation to--mostly failed-- experiments in building Hollywood-style national film industries, and in relation to regional discourses of underdevelopment and mestizaje. Since the late 1990s, a reassessment of the legacy of the NLAC has been taking shape as scholars have begun to interrogate its canonical status in the face of a changed political climate. In the sphere of filmmaking, contemporary Latin American new wave cinemas are also grappling with that legacy-sometimes disavowing it, sometimes appropriating it. We will situate the NLAC in its historical context, survey its formal achievements and political aspirations, assess its legacy, and take stock of the ways and the reasons that it haunts contemporary production.|Salome Skvirsky|Cobb Hall 311|The New Latin American Cinema and Its Afterlife|1|[54787]|[{'sectionname': 'Section 1S01 [54788] - SCR Open', 'instructor': 'Skvirsky', 'daytime': 'Thu : 03:30 PM-06:30 PM'}]|SEM

We will also compare these evolutions with those of new colonial varieties of European languages (such as Amish English, mainstream American English varieties, Brazilian Portuguese, and Québécois French) which emerged around the same time but are not considered creoles. Using the comparative approach (in evolutionary theory), we will assess whether the criteria used in the genetic classification of languages have been applied uniformly to creole and non-creole languages.

This course will examine this three-hundred-year history by investigating the following essential questions: (1) How did a collection of diverse kingdoms manage to create a global empire? (2) What specific factors can explain the Spanish decline of the seventeenth century? (3) Was the Spanish Empire doomed to fail from the very beginning? (4) Why did many colonial subjects remain loyal to Spain after the Conquest and especially after a century of decline? (5) Why did the empire collapse only after 1808? In our exploration of these questions, we will pay particular attention to Spain's ambitious and pioneering, if also destructive, involvement with conquest, colonial exploitation, chattel slavery, racial domination, and a mission to ""civilize"" the world. We will then proceed to investigate the Spanish decline of the seventeenth century and the influence of the emerging empires of Britain, France, and the Dutch Republic. The course concludes by examining Spain's effort to reform its empire during the eighteenth century, interrogating whether this effort alienated Spanish colonial subjects and ultimately contributed to the dissolution of the empire."|Fidel Tavarez|TBA|The Rise and Fall of the Spanish Empire|1|[42931]|[]|SEM

Historians have often relegated Iberia and its New World domains from accounts of the developments of modern science. They have traditionally claimed that strict censorship and a commitment to orthodox Catholicism prevented Spain, once the most powerful empire of the world, from embarking on the path towards scientific modernity in the eighteenth century. Modern scholars, however, have challenged this narrative by embracing more inclusive concepts of ""science"" to explain the many ways in which early modern people related to nature. Some of these practices include the writing of natural histories, botanical research, and linguistic studies, all fields that Iberian scholars pioneered in their efforts to govern their vast domains. This course will introduce students to a diversity of scientific practices that flourished in the Hispanic world between 1400 and 1800."|Valeria Lopez Fadul|TBA|Nature, Science, and Empire in the Early Modern Iberian World, 1400-1800|1|[42929]|[]|SEM

Fleeing economic, social, and climatological collapse, migrants hardly find a second home; they become refugees without refuge. The limits on their flourishing extend far beyond the national borders that they cross in search of livable life. Wherever they go, they are discriminated and psychologically segregated by discourses of race nationalism, discourses in which migrations give rise to races.

For historians, progress and development used to represent the very sense of universal history, a narrative that sneaked into visions of “Western modernity” and “globalization.” But later on, they became a myth to debunk rather than an object of reflection. What has “progress” meant particularly for Latin Americans? What is, for instance, the meaning of “progress” in the Brazilian flag? How did those notions shape the one of “development” since WWII? In political terms, what ideas of “progress” and “development” animated oligarchic, liberal, populist, military, revolutionary, and democratic projects across the region? Because both concepts involve planning and envisioning the outcome of present actions, the history of progress and development is also, in a certain way, a history of the future. The goal of this seminar is to help students situate a problem of their choice and trace its history in terms of the political debates that pursued the goal of progress and development in that specific realm.|Pablo Palomino|Psychology K114|Progress and Development in Latin America|1|[41611]|[]|LEC

After we review their contemporary modes of political organization we will examine the political history and political organizational strategies of Latinos; analyze public policy issues surrounding citizenship and membership; evaluate the successes and failures of Latino empowerment strategies; and critique the electoral impact of Latino votes. Through this careful examination of Latinos in U.S. politics, we will develop a richer understanding of contemporary US politics and will be able to develop some hypotheses about its trajectory in the 21st Century.|Alfredo Gonzalez|5733 S.

In most democracies, the distribution of wealth among citizens is unequal but the right to vote is universal. Why then have so many newly democratic states transitioned under conditions of high inequality yet failed to redistribute? This course explores this puzzle by analyzing the mechanisms through which individual and group preferences can be translated into pro-poor policies, and the role elites play in influencing a government's capacity or incentives to redistribute wealth. Topics include economic inequality and the demand for redistribution, the difference in redistribution between democracy and dictatorship, the role of globalization in policymaking, and the effects of redistribution on political stability and change.|Michael Albertus|Pick Hall 506|Democracy and the Politics of Wealth Redistribution|1|[41785]|[]|SEM

Through the study of both works of art and the writings of artists and critics, we will investigate new definitions of the art object, revolts against existing institutions of art, and the emergence of performance, media, and conceptual art. These developments will be read against social and political changes in the region, including the impasse of mid-century modernization efforts and the rise of repressive dictatorships.

The New Latin American Cinema (NLAC) of the late 1950s-70s generated unprecedented international enthusiasm for Latin American film production. The filmmakers of this loosely designated movement were defining themselves in relation to global realist film traditions like Italian Neorealism and Griersonian documentary, in relation to--mostly failed-- experiments in building Hollywood-style national film industries, and in relation to regional discourses of underdevelopment and mestizaje. Since the late 1990s, a reassessment of the legacy of the NLAC has been taking shape as scholars have begun to interrogate its canonical status in the face of a changed political climate. In the sphere of filmmaking, contemporary Latin American new wave cinemas are also grappling with that legacy-sometimes disavowing it, sometimes appropriating it. We will situate the NLAC in its historical context, survey its formal achievements and political aspirations, assess its legacy, and take stock of the ways and the reasons that it haunts contemporary production.|Salome Skvirsky|Cobb Hall 311|The New Latin American Cinema and Its Afterlife|1|[54789]|[{'sectionname': 'Section 1S01 [54790] - SCR Open', 'instructor': 'Skvirsky', 'daytime': 'Thu : 03:30 PM-06:30 PM'}]|SEM

We will situate creoles in the context of the plantation settlement colonies that produced them and compare their emergence specifically with that of languages such as English and the Romance languages in Europe. We will also compare these evolutions with those of new colonial varieties of European languages (such as Amish English, mainstream American English varieties, Brazilian Portuguese, and Québécois French) which emerged around the same time but are not considered creoles. Using the comparative approach (in evolutionary theory), we will assess whether the criteria used in the genetic classification of languages have been applied uniformly to creole and non-creole languages. In return, we will explore ways in which genetic creolistics can inform and improve genetic linguistics (including historical dialectology).|Salikoko Mufwene|TBA|Creole Genesis and Genetic Linguistics|1|[54792]|[]|LEC

In Latin America, however, even as almost all nations have democratized and economies have grown, clientelism continues to play an important role in mobilizing voters. This course will use several nations in Latin America, including Mexico, Argentina, and Peru to illustrate why clientelism has survived; how both politicians and parties use it; and some of its consequences for politics, especially representation. This course will use both classic readings as well as more modern scholarly work.

The conceit of the course is to put different regional traditions of melodrama into conversation. In addition to offering a basic orientation, the class will also test the boundaries of the category in our work on the racial melodrama and the conjuncture of documentary form and melodrama.

LACS403011[43846]|Graduate|Open|LACS40301|Wed : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|"How do we know what we know about ancient religions? Historians of religion often begin by turning to texts: either sacred texts, or, in the absence of such scriptures, descriptions of belief and practice by observers from outside the faith. Archaeologists focus their attention on the spaces and traces of religious practice—or at least those that survive—while art historians begin by examining images of deities and religious rites. Yet we often fail to see the extent to which the questions which we ask of all of these diverse sources are conditioned by Christian rhetoric about pagan worship. In this course, we compare two moments when Christians encountered ""pagans"": during the initial Christian construction of a discourse on paganism (and, more broadly, a discourse on religion) during the late Roman empire and during the Spanish discovery of the New World. Our course examines silences and absences in the textual and material records, as well as the divergences between texts and objects, in order to further our understanding of ancient religious practice. We will begin to see the many ways in which, as scholars of religion, we are in effect still Christian theologians, paving the way for new approaches to the study of ancient religion."|Clifford Ando, Claudia Brittenham|Regenstein Library 207|The Discovery of Paganism|1|[43846]|[]|SEM

This graduate seminar will introduce students to fundamental questions in the study of political regimes: What distinguishes democracy from dictatorship? How does the functioning of democratic institutions affect democratic survival? Why are some dictatorships more stable than others, and what role do institutions such as legislatures, parties, and elections play in their stability? What political and economic factors explain regime transitions, and why do transitions tend to cluster both spatially and temporally? The course will examine how these questions are addressed in current scholarship, with an emphasis on enabling students to design research projects that contribute to our understanding of how political regimes function, persist, and change.

This graduate seminar will introduce students to the scholarly literature on redistribution, focusing primarily on recent work. We will study the causes and consequences of redistribution, focusing both on the institutions that shape incentives for governments to implement redistribution, as well as the mechanisms, actors, and international conditions that can erode government incentives or capabilities to redistribute. The emphasis of the course will be twofold: rigorously examining the inferences we can draw from existing work, and designing research that can contribute to a better understanding of the fundamental questions regarding redistributive policies.

Topics include the concept of discounting and present value, portfolio theory and diversification, the theory of efficient capital markets and its applications in securities litigation, corporate capital structure and bond covenants, and the analysis of options and other derivative instruments. The principles and concepts of corporate finance are essential to understanding modern corporate transactions. Increasingly, lawyers must understand these principles in order to structure transactions in ways that achieve particular business objectives. The concepts in this class are also of great value to lawyers outside the corporate area: financial principles can be fruitfully applied to a wide variety of legal questions, ranging from estate planning to the calculation of tort awards. This class assumes no background in finance, and is aimed primarily at students with little or no prior exposure to the field (rather than those with an MBA or with an undergraduate finance major).

LAWS4260301[40595]|Law School|Open|LAWS42603|Mon : 08:30 AM-11:40 AM|"(++, BID, CORE, DOC) This course uses the case method to study the practical aspects of important topics in corporate and entrepreneurial finance. We will apply the concepts and techniques of corporate finance to actual situations. The course is roughly divided into three sections: (1) financing decisions; (2) investment decisions; (3) entrepreneurial finance; and (4) private equity finance. In addition to analyzing the specific financing problems or issues, we will consider how those issues relate to the strategic objectives of the firm. It will be important to examine the ""big picture"" assumptions that are used in the numerical calculations. This course also places a strong emphasis on presentation and discussion skills. It will be important to explain your positions or arguments to each other and to try to argue for the implementation of your recommendations. COURSE PROCEDURES For each class meeting, I will assign study questions concerning one or two case studies. For most of the class period, we will consider the questions and the material in the cases. This includes the first meeting. You are allowed and encouraged, but not required to meet in groups outside of class to discuss and analyze the cases. Each group will submit a two-page memorandum of analysis and recommendations at the beginning of each case discussion. If you are working in a group, I will accept one memorandum from the group and count it for all students in the group. If you choose to do this, the group can include up to 3 students. Each memorandum should be typed and double-spaced. Write these as if you were writing a recommendation to the CEO or major decision maker in the case. The two page limit is for text only. You may attach as many numerical calculations as you wish. Memoranda will not be accepted after the class has met. A memorandum will be given credit if it is handed in and no credit if it is not. Initially, therefore, I will not grade them. However, I will use the memoranda to determine final grades for those students who are on the border of two grades. You should prepare a memorandum for UST, the first class. The readings and articles that I have assigned and will hand out are largely non-technical in nature and summarize the findings of academic research in corporate finance in the recent past. These articles are meant to be background material that will help you analyze the cases. They should not necessarily be cited in the case discussion. You should argue as if you were in a corporate boardroom rather than in a doctoral seminar. The process of arriving at the answer is as important as getting the answer. Because of the nature of this course (and its grading criteria), it is extremely important that you attend every class, arrive on time and be prepared to participate. To help me out, you should bring your name cards to each class. I may not remember who said what without those cards. In the past, students have asked me to hand out my case analysis after the class has discussed the case. I will not do this, because there are usually no absolute right answers. The best cases are deliberately written to be ambiguous. While there are no right answers, there are good arguments and bad arguments. This course is designed to help you learn to distinguish between sensible and senseless arguments. Handing out my analyses would reduce the ambiguity in the cases and partially defeat the purpose of doing cases. If you are uncomfortable with ambiguity, this class may not be for you. PREREQUISITE Students should have an understanding of financial statements. I.e., students should be able to read an income statement, cash flow statement and balance sheet."|Steven Neil Kaplan|Laird Bell Quadrangle D|Corporate and Entrepreneurial Finance|01|[40595]|[]|CRS
LAWS4280101[40579]|Law School|Open|LAWS42801|Mon Wed Thu : 01:30 PM-02:35 PM|(BID, CORE) This course is a one-quarter survey of antitrust law. It is designed for students with diverse interests and practice plans. The course should be as valuable to the general business lawyer and the legally trained private equity investor or investment banker as it is to the litigator. There is no assumption of advanced skill or training in economics and no complex mathematical or economic tools are required. Antitrust has been defined not by rulemaking and statutory expansion, but by judges deciding cases, one at a time, in the common law tradition, in large part because the antitrust statutes are very terse and compact (unlike statues in other business fields such as securities regulation, banking regulation and the regulation of telecommunications). Most antitrust issues have been back and forth to the Supreme Court repeatedly. This allows students to see how succeeding generations of great judges have wrestled with the core issues in the field. For these reasons, the great beauty of antitrust is to see it as, essentially, a common law subject, evolving and adapting over its 120-year history. We will do that by reading and studying the wonderful opinions that enliven this field.|Andrew Rosenfield|Laird Bell Quadrangle F|Antitrust Law|01|[40579]|[]|CRS

In 1969, the Supreme Court famously declared that students do not ""shed their constitutional rights when they enter the schoolhouse gate."" Not surprisingly, though, Supreme Court Justices both before and since have bitterly contested the precise scope of students' constitutional rights in the elementary and secondary school contexts. Some Justices, moreover, have concluded that it is typically unwise for the judiciary to enter the educational realm, lest the Supreme Court turn into a schoolboard for the entire nation. Even if such fears are overblown, however, there can be no doubt that the Court's constitutional interpretations have had significant consequences for schools charged with transforming students into citizens. Constitutional topics will include: freedom of speech, establishment of religion, free exercise of religion, searches and seizures, cruel and unusual punishment, due process, and equal protection. Educational topics will include: homeschooling, zero tolerance policies, corporal punishment, school funding, school uniforms, racial desegregation, strip searches, single-sex schools, off campus speech, drug testing, unauthorized immigration, the school-to-prison pipeline, and book banning.

LAWS4324801[40571]|Law School|Open|LAWS43248|Tue : 09:45 AM-01:15 PM|(++, SKLL, BID, CORE, DOC) This course is designed to refresh your knowledge of basic financial accounting [first two weeks of class] and then aims to aggressively increase your ability to be a highly sophisticated user of financial statements. After taking this course, you should improve your ability to determine a firm's accounting policy for a particular type of transaction and to determine how that policy choice affects its primary financial statements. You will also learn how to question whether these effects fairly reflect the underlying economics of the firm's transactions. Asking these questions involves an interplay between accounting, economics, finance, law and business strategy. You should therefore greatly improve your ability to use an accounting report as part of an overall assessment of the firm's strategy and the potential rewards and risks of dealing with the firm. The teaching approach will be a roughly equal combination of lecture time and demanding case applications of the lecture material that will involve group case assignments that will form the basis for in-class discussion of the cases. The technical knowledge acquired from the lecture material is applied to cases where the main goal is to examine how the reported financial statements would differ if the firm had used different accounting policies. The focus is on modifying the reported financial statements in order to obtain the cleanest possible inputs for use in such applications as equity valuation, transaction structuring and credit analysis. The topics to be discussed are likely to include the accounting for, and interpretation of: revenue recognition, intercorporate investments, organizational structures (e.g., franchising), debt, and leases. Intensive group hand-in cases will be used to illustrate how the flexibility in financial reporting can reflect both the economics of the firm and the incentives of the managers creating the financial statements. It is REQUIRED that students registering for this course have prior exposure to accounting course work, at least at the level of Fundamentals of Accounting for Attorneys (LAWS 79112 or 53260), but with a strong preference for the stronger background knowledge provided by the Booth course Financial Accounting (B30000).|Philip Berger|Laird Bell Quadrangle E|Accounting and Financial Analysis|01|[40571]|[]|CRS

It involves a transaction in which an investor in one country (home state) sends capital to another (host state). But in many cases the transaction is subject to what is called in economics a dynamic inconsistency problem, in which the host state’s incentives change once the investment is sunk, and it may want to renege on its promises to the investor. Furthermore, neither side is likely to want any disputes adjudicated in the courts of the other’s country. The global investment regime has arisen to help resolve these problems. The regime includes bilateral investment treaties (known as BITs) as well as multilateral agreements that are embedded in broader treaty structures, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) or the Energy Charter Treaty.

LAWS4741101[40616]|Law School|Open|LAWS47411|Tue Fri : 01:30 PM-03:15 PM|(1E, BID, CORE) An examination of classic jurisprudential questions in and around the theory of adjudication: the theory of how judges actually do decide cases and how they ought to decide them. These questions include: Do legal rules really constrain judicial decision-making? What makes a rule (or norm) a rule of the legal system? Are principles of morality legally binding even when such principles have not been enacted into a law by a legislature? (Relatedly, are there objective principles of morality?) When no legal norm controls a case, how ought judges to decide that case? Can there be right answers to legal disputes, even when informed judges and lawyers disagree about the answer? Are there principles or methods of legal reasoning that constrain judicial decision-making, or is legal reasoning essentially indeterminate, such that a skillful judge can justify more than one outcome for any given dispute? Is judicial decision-making really distinct from political decision-making of the sort legislators engage in? Readings drawn exclusively from major twentieth-century schools of thought - especially American Legal Realism (e.g., Karl Llewellyn, Jerome Frank), Natural Law (e.g., Ronald Dworkin, John Finnis), and Legal Positivism (e.g., H.L.A. Hart, Joseph Raz) - supplemented by other pertinent readings (from Leslie Green, Richard Posner, and the instructor, among others). No familiarity with either jurisprudence or philosophy will be presupposed, though some readings will be philosophically demanding, and the course will sometimes venture into (and explain) cognate philosophical issues in philosophy of language and metaethics as they are relevant to the core jurisprudential questions.

Such adversaries may include foreign intelligence services, terrorists, foreign criminal enterprises, cyber intruders, or some combination thereof. The seminar will consider both legal and policy issues raised in efforts to prevent adversarial espionage action -- overt, covert, or clandestine -- targeting US military, diplomatic, and economic interests at home and abroad.

China is growing stronger and more influential in every domain worldwide and likely to increasingly threaten the status quo. The U.S., meanwhile, finds itself in the grips of a populist movement led by President Trump, who is openly critical of China. The relationship, which was already mistrustful, has grown even more fragile and anxious in recent weeks with talk of tariffs, Taiwan, and the South China Sea. The accusations and threats suggest that we are likely to witness greater turbulence than what we have experienced in the past forty years. The reality is that both nations need each other; both have significant economic, political, and security interests at stake. If the two nations learn how to collaborate, they could conceivably solve the world’s greatest problems. Alternatively, if they elect to contest each other at every turn, the result will be global instability and crisis. Clearly, a new framework for cooperation and collaboration is needed – quite possibly “a new deal,” in the language of President Trump. What will constitute such a deal? How will it work? How likely is a deal, and, if one does occur, will it survive the volatility of an America First foreign policy? This seminar will advocate that the two nations develop a new, fifty-year treaty in the form of a strategic cooperation agreement. We will define the rationale and the case for action, draft major components of the proposed treaty, outline the pathway required for adoption, and transmit our end-product to foreign policy authorities in Washington and Beijing.

LAWS5331701[40589]|Law School|List|LAWS53317|Mon : 04:00 PM-06:00 PM|(BID, LEC, SIM) Since the financial crisis of 2008, regulators and prosecutors around the world increasingly expect companies to have state of the art governance, risk and compliance programs as a condition for remaining in business and for avoiding liabilities for regulatory missteps. Increasingly, regulatory rules are becoming more complex and authorities are becoming more unforgiving, with stepped up efforts to secure criminal and civil penalties against companies, their executives, lawyers and auditors. For companies, such liability can at best result in plummeting share prices, and at worst the shutting down of an enterprise. For individuals, they can result in incarceration, fines, penalties and removal from the business. While many of the principles apply to all industries, the seminar will explore the regulatory and legal foundations for these programs primarily through the lens of the financial services sector, which includes banks, brokerage firms, investment companies and investment advisers. We will also explore how the design and execution of these programs can avoid or limit potential liabilities from regulatory and criminal authorities. From the perspective of a corporate executive, board member or counsel, students will develop the ability to understand the fundamentals of regulatory regimes overseeing these businesses, as well as strategies for successfully engaging the regulators.

Students will serve as law clerks to justices of the Hopi Appellate Court, doing legal research, writing bench memoranda, and drafting opinions on live cases. Students will do all their coursework and assigned casework at the University of Chicago with site visits to the respective Hopi legal institutions to attend oral arguments, present findings to Hopi tribal officials, and participate in judicial deliberations. In so doing, they will be directly involved in testing the socio-legal principles, theories and critiques they explore in class in the crucible of the work they do helping to lay the regulatory and legal foundations for Hopi tribal institutions. In this practicum, almost every project that a student will work on will involve important questions of first impression with respect to a wide variety of pressing, yet enduring sociolegal issues, including issues of constitutionalism (separations of powers, checks and balances, etc.), crime and punishment (criminal law enforcement and defendants' and victims' rights), civil procedure (due process, appellate procedure, motions and orders), private law (property, contract, family), pluralism (the role of Anglo-American vs. Hopi traditional norms, and alternative dispute resolution), among many others.

In addition to situating the Chinese legal materials in their varying legal, social, political, cultural and historical contexts, and thereby highlighting some of their unique elements, the course also familiarizes students with a wide range of theoretical materials (eg., anthropological, legal philosophical, economic, etc.) which may be useful in bringing to light any universalities of legal systems and behavior. However, discussion of any given text will be directed in large part by the nature and contents of the material itself. The Chinese materials, all readings of which will be in translation, range from commemorative inscriptions cast in bronze sacral vessels and descriptions of legal practices in received texts, to actual statutes and case records, philosophical texts and legal debates. The medium, discovery/transmission, and authorship of each document will be given due consideration for the effect they may have on our understanding of the contemporary legal context from which the text derives. The course culminates with student presentations on the material of their choice. Preparation for presentations will be conducted in consult with the instructor. Students are encouraged to draw from their study of other legal systems and/or systems of legal thought (both modern and pre-modern) in their discussion of the ancient Chinese material.

The members of the class will then have a simulated negotiation based on written hypothetical situations in which they will be attempting to reach an agreement and negotiate contractual language that would be part of the type of agreement at issue. In the simulated negotiation for each type of agreement all members of the class will be identified as counsel or a business representative for either (a) the buyer or (b) the target or the seller. The class will be divided into four groups, two (Group 1 and Group 2) for the buyer and two (Group 3 and Group 4) for the target or seller. Group 1 will negotiate with Group 3. Group 2 will separately negotiate with Group 4. Groups 1 and 3 will not communicate with Groups 2 and 4. Each student will be counsel to a party at least once. We will also have short discussions about negotiation ethics and about negotiating and drafting. Grades will be based on: (i) two three to five page papers describing the student’s negotiating experience for each agreement, and what the student would do differently in the future; (ii) classroom performance; and (iii) the contractual language submitted for each agreement (or what they proposed if no agreement is reached). Some of the topics in this course will also be covered in Mergers and Acquisitions, but that course is not a prerequisite for this course and students may take both courses.|Scott Davis|Laird Bell Quadrangle F|Merger and Acquisition Agreements|01|[40625]|[]|SEM
LAWS5337501[40637]|Law School|Open|LAWS53375|Thu : 09:45 AM-11:45 AM|(++, BID, CORE, SEM, SRP) In this seminar we shall explore some key concepts in corporate law from a theoretical (i.e. non-doctrinal) perspective. The materials will borrow heavily from the economic, psychological, financial and accounting literature. By the same token no formal education in either of these disciplines or in math is expected. Doctrinal materials will be treated as empirical observations. For instance, we might note that a given judicial dictum was made by some court as one notes the occurrence of facts, but then explore whether that dictum generates an optimal result. The seminar will be divided in two parts. During approximately the first half of the quarter I shall deliver introductory lectures. In the second half the students will make oral presentations on topics of their choice, which naturally will pertain to the subject of the seminar. Prior to making those presentations the students will be expected to consult with me in order to make sure that their respective presentations are going in the right direction. By the end of the term the students will submit a written paper on the subject of their oral presentations. There will be no final exam. The final grade for students choosing not to be evaluated on a pass/fail basis will be the oral presentation (10%), class participation (10%) and the final written paper (80%).

The first class will take the form of an interview. Prospective clerks will face a range of questions designed to test their approach to statutory and constitutional interpretation while gauging their familiarity with pending, recent, and seminal cases. (You will all be hired!) In subsequent classes, clerks will: (1) circulate and review cert-pool memos for actual, pending petitions for writs of certiorari. These memos help the full Court determine which cases to hear on the merits; (2) review merits briefs and write a bench memo to assist your Justice at oral argument and at Conference (where the Justices meet to resolve argued matters); (3) draft a judicial opinion assigned to your Justice (which may well entail a judgment or legal reasoning the clerk does not agree with); and (4) lead class discussion and debate for the cert-pool and merits cases for which the clerk took primary responsibility. Over the course of the seminar, each clerk will write three cert-pool memos, one bench memo, and one opinion. The seminar is aimed at students who have or seek a state or federal clerkship and those with a possible interest in clerking for a U.S. Supreme Court Justice. A firm background in constitutional law is strongly recommended, and your open-minded Justice seeks applicants with a wide array of political and jurisprudential perspectives. Grades will be based on a combination of draft opinions, class participation, cert-pool memos, and bench memos. Students may only enroll with the permission of the instructor.

While Trump’s supporters celebrated the victory of their candidate, many of Trump’s critics argued that Trump’s election was illegitimate, and demonstrators took to the streets. Even after a short time in office, Trump’s actions have—according to his critics—showed a profound indifference to democratic institutions. They complain that he has violated constitutional norms by retaining his business ties, issuing aggressive executive orders, and attacking the press, among other actions. But are the critics right? Is Trump a normal president or a constitutional aberration? We will examine these questions from the standpoint of law, history, and political theory.

LAWS5339301[44036]|Law School|Open|LAWS53393|Wed : 04:00 PM-06:00 PM|(BID, LEC, SEM) After Obama’s historical election, many declared that the United States had finally become a post-racial nation. The assumption was that if the country could elect a black President, then surely racism and prejudice were evils of the past. But then came the killings of Freddie Gray, Michael Brown, Sandra Bland, Eric Garner and others, and the community responses in Ferguson, Baltimore, and other cities across the country. These events, in turn, led to several criminal trials and federal investigations, and showed the salience of race in the operation of the criminal justice system. The assertion that “Black Lives Matter” became a rallying cry, and what started as a hashtag turned into a movement. This seminar will examine the role of law in creating and recreating race in our decidedly non-post-racial society. Topics covered will include racial identity, education, and criminal justice. Readings will include cases to understand the “law on the books;” law review articles to understand how legal academics interact the law and its implications; and social science research to understand “law in action.” Students will be evaluated as follows. For 2 credits, students will write three response papers, 4-5 pages each, on 3 different set of readings, due the day before that class meets.

The litigators (and corporate lawyers) who concentrate in this area must function in an environment where the stakes are high, leverage is critical, and “victory” is defined by the client, not the court. Accordingly, this seminar examines the critical questions faced in virtually every financial services litigation matter including: (1) which is the most favorable venue for this litigation, including consideration of how legal principles vary jurisdiction by jurisdiction; (2) how does Directors and Officers Liability insurance impact the litigation, itself; (3) strategic considerations relating to the composition of the board and use of special litigation committees; (4) how dispositive motions can be used to, at a minimum, best frame and limit the litigation; (5) how derivative and class certification mechanisms can be used to narrow or defeat claims; (6) how to use the timing and positioning of mediation to produce a favorable result for the client; (7) who of your pool of potential experts should be identified, on what topics, and when to maximize chances of success; and (8) what is jury research and what role does it play in making thematic and settlement decisions. To further the student experience, we will supplement our sessions by bringing some of the nation’s top litigators and practioners in fields like jury research, D&O insurance, mediation and/or damage analysis to share their years of expertise drawn from real world situations.

In the process, we enjoy many opportunities to explore whether and how program structures reflect or reinforce prevailing cultural attitudes and assumptions about program participants including attitudes and assumptions based on gender and race.

It admits approximately ten students. Its aim is to study, each year, a topic that arises in both philosophy and the law and to ask how bringing the two fields together may yield mutual illumination. Most sessions are led by visiting speakers, from either outside institutions or our own faculty, who circulate their papers in advance. The session consists of a brief introduction by the speaker, followed by initial questioning by the two faculty coordinators, followed by general discussion, in which students are given priority. The topic for 2016-17 will expose students to cutting-edge work in general jurisprudence, that part of philosophy of law concerned with the central questions about the nature of law, the relationship between law and morality, and the nature of legal reasoning. We will be particularly interested in the way in which work in philosophy of language, metaethics, metaphysics, and other cognate fields of philosophy has influenced recent scholarly debates that have arisen in the wake of H.L.A. Hart’s seminal The Concept of Law (1961). Please see www.law.uchicago.edu/workshops/lawandphilosophy for additional information concerning each session. Usual participants include graduate students in philosophy, political science, and divinity, and law students. Students write a 20-25 page seminar paper at the end of the year.

LAWS9021101[54996]|Law School|Open|LAWS90211|Tue : 10:25 AM-12:10 PM|The Young Center for Immigrant Children's Rights Clinic combines international human rights law, immigration law and children's rights law. Students in the clinic are appointed by the federal government as Child Advocate (similar to a guardian ad litem) for unaccompanied immigrant children detained in Chicago. Unaccompanied immigrant children come to the U.S. from all corners of the world, on their own. They are apprehended—typically at the U.S./Mexico border—then detained and placed in deportation proceedings. Direct Client Service: Pursuant to federal law, the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, the Young Center is appointed as Child Advocate for the most vulnerable of these children (tender age children, children with mental or physical disabilities, children who have experienced extensive trauma, etc.). Law students serve as Child Advocate for individual children, and are responsible for advocating for the best interests of the assigned child on issues relating to safe repatriation, legal relief, care, custody and release. Each student meets weekly with the child at the detention facility, and advocates on behalf of the child with federal officials, including immigration judges and asylum officers, under the supervision of Young Center attorneys. Since there currently is no substantive best interests of the child standard under the Immigration and Nationality Act, students look to international human rights law, including the Convention on the Rights of the Child, state child welfare law, and the child protection laws of the child’s home country. Policy Advocacy: In addition to serving as Child Advocate, clinic students have the opportunity to engage in legislative and policy advocacy aimed at improving the immigration system for children in removal proceedings. This is an especially critical time since the government projects 70,000 children will arrive at the border this year. Young Center students will do policy advocacy aimed at reforming procedural and substantive legal protections, including the appointment of counsel for immigrant children and incorporation of a substantive best interests of the child standard in the Immigration and Nationality Act. Students must enroll in the Autumn quarter and participate in a 2-day orientation on Oct 1st and 2nd (Saturday and Sunday). The Young Center Clinic admits both second-year and third-year law students.

With the permission of the clinical teacher, students may choose to focus on litigation, legislation, or both. Students engaged in litigation may interview clients and witnesses; research and draft pleadings and legal memoranda, including briefs to reviewing courts; conduct formal and informal discovery; negotiate with opposing counsel and others; conduct evidentiary hearings and trials; and present oral argument in trial and appellate courts. Students who have completed fifty percent of the credits needed for graduation may be licensed to appear, under the supervision of the clinical teacher, in state and federal trial and appellate courts pursuant to court rules and practices. Students engaged in legislative advocacy may research and draft legislation and supporting materials, devise and implement strategies to obtain the enactment or defeat of legislation, negotiate with representatives of various interest groups, and testify in legislative hearings. In addition to discrete advocacy skills such as cross-examination, discovery planning, and legislative drafting, the course aims to provide students with an understanding of the relationships between individual advocacy tasks and the ultimate goals of clients, between litigation and legislative advocacy, and between advocacy on behalf of individual clients and advocacy for systemic change. Prior or contemporaneous enrollment in Law and the Mental Health System is encouraged, but not required, for all students. See the general rules for all clinical courses for further details concerning enrollment, including the rules governing the award of credit.

Through the lens of live-client work, students examine how and where litigation fits into broader efforts to improve police accountability and ultimately the criminal justice system. Students provide legal services to indigent victims of police abuse in federal and state courts. They litigate civil rights cases at each level of the court system from trial through appeals. Some students also represent children and adults in related juvenile or criminal defense matters. Students take primary responsibility for all aspects of the litigation, including client counseling, fact investigation, case strategy, witness interviews, legal research, pleadings and legal memoranda, discovery, depositions, motion practice, evidentiary hearings, trials, and appeals. A significant amount of legal writing is expected. Students work in teams on cases or projects, and meet with the instructor on at minimum a weekly basis. Students also take primary responsibility for the Clinic’s policy and public education work. PAP teaches students to apply and critically examine legal theory in the context of representation of people in need. It teaches students to analyze how and why individual cases of abuse occur and to connect them to systemic problems, often leading to “public impact” litigation and other strategies for policy reform. Through our immersion in live client work, we engage fundamental issues of race, class, and gender, and their intersection with legal institutions.

By 2016, however, it has become clear that race is still central to public policy discussions about policing, economic inequality, immigration, and terrorism, among other areas. In this Greenberg, we examine an emerging literature on the persistence of race and racial ideologies and their consequences for America, particularly as the U.S. becomes an increasingly multi-ethnic and multi-racial society.

This is a history class that situates itself within a robust interdisciplinary conversation. Students can expect to engage works of autobiography and poetry, sociology, documentary photography, and political science as well as more straightforward historical analysis.

This course will be an experiment in linking the extremely pragmatic and the extremely conceptual. Working from a few of the most successful speeches of Presidents Reagan and Obama, we will look to see how the pragmatic and the philosophical shape each other. We will spend roughly half our time on speech-writing nuts-and-bolts, and half our time on some of the philosophical commitments reflected in the language of these two political leaders. (In addition to the speeches themselves, the course reading will include philosophical texts that will provide a frame for examining these commitments.)

In most democracies, the distribution of wealth among citizens is unequal but the right to vote is universal. Why then have so many newly democratic states transitioned under conditions of high inequality yet failed to redistribute? This course explores this puzzle by analyzing the mechanisms through which individual and group preferences can be translated into pro-poor policies, and the role elites play in influencing a government's capacity or incentives to redistribute wealth. Topics include economic inequality and the demand for redistribution, the difference in redistribution between democracy and dictatorship, the role of globalization in policymaking, and the effects of redistribution on political stability and change.|Michael Albertus|Pick Hall 506|Democracy and the Politics of Wealth Redistribution|1|[41786]|[]|SEM

The main objective of the course is to gain insight into the scope of spatial regression methods, to be able to apply them in an empirical setting, and to properly interpret the results of spatial regression analysis. While the focus is on spatial aspects, the types of methods covered have general validity in statistical practice. The course covers the specification of spatial regression models in order to incorporate spatial dependence and spatial heterogeneity, as well as different estimation methods and specification tests to detect the presence of spatial autocorrelation and spatial heterogeneity. Special attention is paid to the application to spatial models of generic statistical paradigms, such as Maximum Likelihood, Generalized Methods of Moments and the Bayesian perspective.

We begin by surveying the development and trajectory of the field, particularly as it develops around debates on revolution and compromise, cosmopolitanism, the psychology of colonialism, and anti-colonial historiography. Alongside this, we consider the recent disciplinary revival of the categories of “global Anglophone” and “world literature” through readings on “literary worlds” to to evaluate these categories, and their contributions to ongoing debates about translation/translatability, vernaculars, rewriting, and mimicry. What are the claims made on behalf of literary texts in orienting us to other lives and possibilities, and in registering the experience of geographic and cultural displacement? To better answer this, we read recent scholarship that engages the field in conversations around intimacy, belonging, and human rights, to think about the impulses that animate the field, and its possible futures. Readings will likely include works by Debjani Ganguly, Kamau Brathwaite, Jean Rhys, Amitava Kumar, Sara Ahmed and Amitav Ghosh.|Darrel Chia|TBA|Postcolonial Openings|1|[54368]|[]|SEM

Worrying ourselves into the realm of the pathological, we now have a requisite measure of anxiety for every prescribed stage of life. But why are we so anxious? Considering its prevalence in everyday life, the concept and theories of anxiety have been employed surprisingly seldom as a way into film, fiction, and art. In this course we examine the modern origin of contemporary discourses specific to anxiety and their unique manifestation in cultural artifacts. To understand the complex of anxiety in the so-called Western world, we rely on the theories of Søren Kierkegaard, Martin Heidegger, Sigmund Freud, Jacques Lacan, and Alenka Zupančič; fiction by Stoker, Schnitzler, Kafka, and Sebald; and film by Haneke, Kubrick, Ophuls, and Hitchcock.

MAPH378181[42899]|Graduate|Open|MAPH37818|Mon Wed : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM|In American popular culture, the eighteenth century is remembered today (to the extent that it is remembered at all) as a heady time of revolutions and revolutionaries, when towering figures of the Enlightenment established modern democracy. This, in many ways, reflects the narrative eighteenth-century writers were developing about their own age. For British Whigs, the “Glorious Revolution” of 1688 had been a watershed moment at which the arbitrary rule of kings had been replaced for all time by constitutionalism; the social contract and the civil polity had triumphed over divine-right ideology, ushering in a new, beneficent era of progress. And, in the 1790s, the French Revolution fired the political imaginations of British radicals who saw the potential for a world made anew – a world of universal suffrage and gender equality, where slavery was abolished. Clearly, attaining these goals was a long way off. The debates over the structures, meanings, and nature of consent had tendrils in multiple areas of society – the law, of course, but also in understandings of sexuality, constructions of gender, economics, and colonization. Questions of rights, agency, and authority (what those categories meant, who could possess them, and who guaranteed them) were by no means settled, and, indeed, throughout the century, calls to curtail the categories of people who should have access to the sphere of political influence were often as boisterous as those to expand such access. This course will explore how a range of authors in eighteenth-century Britain figured questions of consent, rights, and authority and how the ideological debates these authors mediated continue to inform contemporary politics, cultures, and identities. We will read works by literary figures such as Daniel Defoe, Samuel Richardson, Mary Hays, Olaudah Equiano, and Mary Shelley. We will consider the writings of some of the major political philosophers of the day, as well, including John Locke, Thomas Hobbes, Mary Astell, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Thomas Paine, and Mary Wollstonecraft. We will additionally discuss readings in modern criticism and theory to help us better situate our primary texts in the discourses of modernity and better understand their lasting resonances.|Tristan Schweiger|TBA|Consent and Coercion: Rights, Agency, and Authority in the Eighteenth Century and Beyond|1|[42899]|[]|SEM

This class will read science fiction, feminist theory and current critical work that concerns itself with bios, biology and biopolitics in order to ask questions about the divide between nature and culture, what’s entailed in imagining the future, what gender and genre have to do with each other, and just what science fiction is and does anyway.

Students completing MATH 13100-13200-13300 have a command of calculus equivalent to that obtained in MATH 15100-15200-15300. Students may not take the first two quarters of this sequence for P/F grading. MATH 13100-13200 meets the general education requirement in the mathematical sciences. MATH 13100 gives a careful treatment of limits, the continuity and differentiability of algebraic functions, and applications of the derivative.

Lebesgue measure is the most important example but, depending upon the application, the ‘size’ of a set may be measured in many different, very interesting ways. The interplay between measure and geometry can be extremely subtle and has given rise to powerful ideas that are used in energy minimisation problems, the theory of partial differential equations and the study of fractal geometry. The goal of the course is to study the geometric structure of Borel sets and Borel measures in the Euclidean space.

MEDC313001[40731]|Pritzker School of Medicine|Open|MEDC31300|Mon Wed : 03:00 PM-04:20 PM|This intermediate-level epidemiology course directed by two infectious disease epidemiologist-physicians will provide an up to date perspective on forgotten, contemporary and emerging infections. The course lectures and readings will provide a rigorous examination of the interactions among pathogens, hosts and the environment that produce disease in diverse populations. In addition to the demographic characteristics and the behaviors of individuals that are associated with a high risk of infection, we will examine complex aspects of the environment as they pertain to disease transmission. These include poverty, globalization, social networks, public health, and racial and ethnic disparities. Methodologic approaches to infectious disease epidemiology that will be covered include traditional study designs, molecular epidemiology, social network analysis, modeling, and network science. Local and global approaches will be applied to case studies from the United States, Asia and Africa.|Michael David|BioSci Learning Center 218|Infectious Disease Epidemiology; Networks and Modeling|1|[40731]|[]|LEC

The tools of engineering are important in making and translating basic discoveries in other fields into new intellectual opportunities and, sometimes, useful technologies. Institute for Molecular Engineering The Institute for Molecular Engineering (IME) is founded on the principle of collaborative problem-solving, not rigid academic disciplines. It is at the forefront of an emerging field that has the potential to address fundamental problems of societal import. This exciting new field involves the incorporation of synthetic molecular building blocks into functional systems that will impact technologies from advanced medical therapies to quantum computing. Created in partnership with Argonne National Laboratory, the IME builds on the tradition of collaboration and cutting-edge research well established at Argonne and the University of Chicago. It conducts research at the intersection of chemical, electrical, mechanical, and biological engineering, as well as materials, biological, and physical sciences. The institute’s exploration of innovative technologies in nanoscale manipulation and design at a molecular scale has the potential for impact in such areas as energy, health care, and the environment. Major Program in Molecular Engineering The BS degree program in Molecular Engineering offers undergraduates a cutting-edge engineering curriculum built on a strong foundation in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology. Courses are designed to develop quantitative reasoning and problem-solving skills; to introduce engineering analysis of physical, chemical, and biological systems; and to address open-ended technological questions across a spectrum of disciplines. The program will both prepare undergraduates for a wide variety of careers in technology-focused industries and position graduates for further postgraduate study in such fields as science, engineering, medicine, business, or law. The aim is to introduce invention and design, along with inquiry and discovery, as fruitful and complementary intellectual activities. Majors are able to choose from two quantitative engineering analysis tracks, one aimed at engineering with a biological, chemical, and soft materials emphasis, and one geared toward applied physics. The applied physics track, offered in close collaboration with the Department of Physics, is one of the first initiatives worldwide to formally educate quantum engineers at the undergraduate level. MENG 29500 Engineering Design is a 300-unit design course offered as a capstone, in which student teams spend an intensive quarter working with a faculty mentor to solve an open-ended problem, for example, analyzing chemical and biological properties of cancer cells to develop new treatment and delivery vehicles or harnessing the properties of electrons in materials to develop quantum information technologies. The course also combines technical skills with an exploration of economics, regulatory and legal issues, and ethics. Major Program Requirements 1. A strong and broad background in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology. It is imperative for a modern engineer to have a strong and broad background in the sciences. Traditional engineering disciplines have had requirements in math, chemistry, and physics for decades and many programs have evolved to require biology as well. The highly interdisciplinary nature of Molecular Engineering requires a foundation built across the mathematical, physical, and biological sciences. Students are encouraged to complete their general education requirements at the highest level for which they are prepared. This will position them better to take advantage of advanced electives and research opportunities. As discussed in more detail below, there will be two tracks for Molecular Engineering majors, one aimed towards engineering with a biological, chemical, and soft materials emphasis, and one aimed towards applied physics. Students in the former track will follow precedent set by Chemistry and Biological Sciences majors in that they will likely take chemistry in year 1, physics in year 2, and follow the recommended mathematics courses in the Chemistry curriculum. Students in the latter track will follow precedent set by Physics majors in that they will likely take physics in year 1, follow the mathematics guidelines of Physics majors, and take chemistry in year 2. 2. MENG 26030 Introduction to Engineering Analysis. One of the first courses for all Molecular Engineering majors, this course teaches students to apply mathematical methods towards solving problems that cut across multiple engineering sub-disciplines. A major objective of the course is to teach simple programming skills and computational methods in applied mathematics, including the use of engineering software such as Matlab, Mathematica, Comsol, and elements of Python. The skills that are introduced here will be further developed and strengthened throughout the rest of the curriculum. 3. Two quantitative engineering analysis tracks: Biological, Chemical, and Soft Materials Engineering and Quantum Engineering. Reflecting the research and education themes of the IME, two highly intertwined but recognizably different tracks for the major are available to students. One is aimed at preparing students oriented towards biological, chemical, and soft materials engineering, and the other is aimed at preparing students oriented towards engineering of quantum-based materials, devices, and processes. The latter track is offered in close collaboration with the Department of Physics. The main difference in the tracks relates to a choice between two sequences of three courses under the heading of quantitative engineering analysis. 4. MENG 29500 Engineering Design (300-unit capstone course). This “immersion” design course teaches students how to bring combinations of fundamental science and engineering together to solve open-ended and challenging engineering problems. It also serves as a vehicle to teach other equally important non-technical skills, including: • Problem identification: technology analysis, competitive analysis, market analysis, stakeholder analysis, product definition • Impact of the project, including sociological and engineering ethics • Project planning • Project economics: costs, value/investment analysis, risk analysis and adjustment • Prototyping, experimental design, data analysis, error analysis • IP: patenting, prior art, patentability • Legal and regulatory analysis • Proposing, presenting and reporting • Teamwork IME faculty and fellows will propose open-ended projects for which they will serve as mentors. Students will work together in groups of three. 5. Materials and advanced electives (3 required courses in the major). The major is offered in such a way as to allow for considerable flexibility for students to tailor their programs along individualized trajectories, with help from faculty advisors. Not only can students choose between two tracks, but they can further build breadth or depth through their choice of a materials course and advanced electives. Moreover, we anticipate that our students will use their general electives outside of the major requirements to strengthen their backgrounds in specific areas of interest, also in consultation with Molecular Engineering advisors, to achieve desired outcomes such as preparation for graduate school in more traditional engineering disciplines. 6. Laboratory skills and hands-on experience. Critical skills that molecular engineers must acquire as part of their educational program include the ability to apply knowledge of mathematics, science, and engineering and the ability to design and conduct experiments, as well as the ability to analyze and interpret data. Molecular Engineering majors develop these skills through lab components associated with required courses in the physical and biological sciences, Molecular Engineering courses including MENG 26101-26102 Transport Phenomena I: Forces + Flows; Transport Phenomena II, MENG 26201-26202 Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics I-II, MENG 29500 Engineering Design, and some of the advanced electives such as MENG 27300 Polymer Physics and Engineering. We also anticipate that many Molecular Engineering students will receive advanced laboratory experience pursuing undergraduate research projects. 7. Non-technical skills. Many decades of workshops and panels engaging stakeholders in academia and industry, often associated with the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET), have identified criteria for outcomes of students in accredited engineering education programs. Although there is no thought of seeking ABET accreditation for the Molecular Engineering major, many ABET criteria, particularly those related to non-technological skills, are viewed as essential to incorporate into the Molecular Engineering major. Examples of student outcomes that fall into this category include: (a) an ability to formulate or design a system, process, or program to meet desired needs, (b) an ability to function on multidisciplinary teams, (c) an understanding of professional and ethical responsibility, (d) an ability to communicate effectively, (e) the broad education necessary to understand the impact of solutions in a global and societal context, (f) a recognition of the need for and an ability to engage in life-long learning, and (g) a knowledge of contemporary issues. Many of these outcomes will be addressed through both the Molecular Engineering degree curriculum (emphasized in the design sequence and the research colloquium) and the College general education requirements. Students who are able to both develop and articulate these skills will be positioned favorably for employment in industry and for postgraduate study (engineering, medicine, law, and business administration). Entering the Program Students must indicate their intent to pursue the BS program at the end of the Autumn Quarter in their second year of study by completing the Intent to Pursue Molecular Engineering questionnaire (available on the IME website). They begin the engineering curriculum in the following Spring Quarter with enrollment in either MENG 26010 Engineering Principles of Conservation or MENG 26020 Engineering Electrodynamics. Both courses require the completion of their stated prerequisites. Students should work with their advisers early in their first year of study to plan for those prerequisites to be completed in a timely manner.

The overall objective of the program is to provide basic engineering tools and ways of thinking to students that augment scientific approaches and problem solving skills. Minor Program Requirements Before a student can declare the minor in molecular engineering, the student must: Complete the general education requirements in mathematics and physical or biological sciences Earn a B or higher in MENG 20000 Introduction to Emerging Technologies Following completion of the general education requirements and MENG 20000 Introduction to Emerging Technologies (with a grade of B or better), students may apply to the director of undergraduate studies of the Institute for Molecular Engineering for admission into the minor in molecular engineering program. A student must receive the director of undergraduate studies’ approval of the minor program on a form obtained from the student's College adviser. Once signed by the director, this form must then be returned to the student's College adviser by the end of Spring Quarter of the student's third year. To earn the minor in molecular engineering, a student must complete five molecular engineering courses chosen in consultation with the director of undergraduate studies. Before meeting with the director, students should invest some thought into which courses they would like to complete for the minor and how those courses relate as a set. MENG 20000 Introduction to Emerging Technologies and MENG 29700 Undergraduate Research for Molecular Engineering must be among the five courses counted toward the minor. In rare cases, courses offered by other departments and programs may be approved by the director of undergraduate studies as substitutes for courses listed above. Courses in the minor program may not be (1) double counted with the student's major(s) or with other minors, or (2) counted toward general education requirements. Courses in the minor must be taken for quality grades, and more than half of the requirements for the minor must be met by registering for courses bearing University of Chicago course numbers. Summary of Requirements for the Minor in Molecular Engineering MENG 20000 Introduction to Emerging Technologies * 100 MENG 29700 Undergraduate Research for Molecular Engineering 100 Three additional courses in Molecular Engineering or other programs ** 300 Total Units 500 * With a grade of B or higher ** Courses not in Molecular Engineering must be approved by the director of undergraduate studies. Grading In order to qualify for the BS degree, a GPA of 2.0 or higher (with no grade lower than C-) is needed in all courses required in the major. Students majoring in Molecular Engineering must receive quality grades in all courses required in the degree program. All courses in the minor must be taken for quality grades. Nonmajors and nonminors may take Molecular Engineering courses on a P/F basis; only grades of C- or higher constitute passing work. Honors Students who pursue a substantive research project with a faculty member of the Institute for Molecular Engineering are encouraged to write and defend an honors thesis based on their work. Students who wish to be considered for honors are expected to complete their arrangements with the director of undergraduate studies before the end of their third year and to register for one quarter of MENG 29700 Undergraduate Research for Molecular Engineering during their third or fourth years. To be eligible to receive honors, students in the BS degree program must write a creditable honors paper describing their research. The paper must be submitted before the deadline established by the director of undergraduate studies and must be approved by the department chairperson. In addition, an oral presentation of the research is required. The research paper or project used to meet this requirement may not be used to meet the BA/BS paper or project requirement in another major. To earn a BS degree with honors in Molecular Engineering, students must also have an overall GPA of 3.0 or higher. Molecular Engineering Courses MENG 20000.

The tools of engineering are important in making and translating basic discoveries in other fields into new intellectual opportunities and, sometimes, useful technologies. Institute for Molecular Engineering The Institute for Molecular Engineering (IME) is founded on the principle of collaborative problem-solving, not rigid academic disciplines. It is at the forefront of an emerging field that has the potential to address fundamental problems of societal import. This exciting new field involves the incorporation of synthetic molecular building blocks into functional systems that will impact technologies from advanced medical therapies to quantum computing. Created in partnership with Argonne National Laboratory, the IME builds on the tradition of collaboration and cutting-edge research well established at Argonne and the University of Chicago. It conducts research at the intersection of chemical, electrical, mechanical, and biological engineering, as well as materials, biological, and physical sciences. The institute’s exploration of innovative technologies in nanoscale manipulation and design at a molecular scale has the potential for impact in such areas as energy, health care, and the environment. Major Program in Molecular Engineering The BS degree program in Molecular Engineering offers undergraduates a cutting-edge engineering curriculum built on a strong foundation in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology. Courses are designed to develop quantitative reasoning and problem-solving skills; to introduce engineering analysis of physical, chemical, and biological systems; and to address open-ended technological questions across a spectrum of disciplines. The program will both prepare undergraduates for a wide variety of careers in technology-focused industries and position graduates for further postgraduate study in such fields as science, engineering, medicine, business, or law. The aim is to introduce invention and design, along with inquiry and discovery, as fruitful and complementary intellectual activities. Majors are able to choose from two quantitative engineering analysis tracks, one aimed at engineering with a biological, chemical, and soft materials emphasis, and one geared toward applied physics. The applied physics track, offered in close collaboration with the Department of Physics, is one of the first initiatives worldwide to formally educate quantum engineers at the undergraduate level. MENG 29500 Engineering Design is a 300-unit design course offered as a capstone, in which student teams spend an intensive quarter working with a faculty mentor to solve an open-ended problem, for example, analyzing chemical and biological properties of cancer cells to develop new treatment and delivery vehicles or harnessing the properties of electrons in materials to develop quantum information technologies. The course also combines technical skills with an exploration of economics, regulatory and legal issues, and ethics. Major Program Requirements 1. A strong and broad background in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology. It is imperative for a modern engineer to have a strong and broad background in the sciences. Traditional engineering disciplines have had requirements in math, chemistry, and physics for decades and many programs have evolved to require biology as well. The highly interdisciplinary nature of Molecular Engineering requires a foundation built across the mathematical, physical, and biological sciences. Students are encouraged to complete their general education requirements at the highest level for which they are prepared. This will position them better to take advantage of advanced electives and research opportunities. As discussed in more detail below, there will be two tracks for Molecular Engineering majors, one aimed towards engineering with a biological, chemical, and soft materials emphasis, and one aimed towards applied physics. Students in the former track will follow precedent set by Chemistry and Biological Sciences majors in that they will likely take chemistry in year 1, physics in year 2, and follow the recommended mathematics courses in the Chemistry curriculum. Students in the latter track will follow precedent set by Physics majors in that they will likely take physics in year 1, follow the mathematics guidelines of Physics majors, and take chemistry in year 2. 2. MENG 26030 Introduction to Engineering Analysis. One of the first courses for all Molecular Engineering majors, this course teaches students to apply mathematical methods towards solving problems that cut across multiple engineering sub-disciplines. A major objective of the course is to teach simple programming skills and computational methods in applied mathematics, including the use of engineering software such as Matlab, Mathematica, Comsol, and elements of Python. The skills that are introduced here will be further developed and strengthened throughout the rest of the curriculum. 3. Two quantitative engineering analysis tracks: Biological, Chemical, and Soft Materials Engineering and Quantum Engineering. Reflecting the research and education themes of the IME, two highly intertwined but recognizably different tracks for the major are available to students. One is aimed at preparing students oriented towards biological, chemical, and soft materials engineering, and the other is aimed at preparing students oriented towards engineering of quantum-based materials, devices, and processes. The latter track is offered in close collaboration with the Department of Physics. The main difference in the tracks relates to a choice between two sequences of three courses under the heading of quantitative engineering analysis. 4. MENG 29500 Engineering Design (300-unit capstone course). This “immersion” design course teaches students how to bring combinations of fundamental science and engineering together to solve open-ended and challenging engineering problems. It also serves as a vehicle to teach other equally important non-technical skills, including: • Problem identification: technology analysis, competitive analysis, market analysis, stakeholder analysis, product definition • Impact of the project, including sociological and engineering ethics • Project planning • Project economics: costs, value/investment analysis, risk analysis and adjustment • Prototyping, experimental design, data analysis, error analysis • IP: patenting, prior art, patentability • Legal and regulatory analysis • Proposing, presenting and reporting • Teamwork IME faculty and fellows will propose open-ended projects for which they will serve as mentors. Students will work together in groups of three. 5. Materials and advanced electives (3 required courses in the major). The major is offered in such a way as to allow for considerable flexibility for students to tailor their programs along individualized trajectories, with help from faculty advisors. Not only can students choose between two tracks, but they can further build breadth or depth through their choice of a materials course and advanced electives. Moreover, we anticipate that our students will use their general electives outside of the major requirements to strengthen their backgrounds in specific areas of interest, also in consultation with Molecular Engineering advisors, to achieve desired outcomes such as preparation for graduate school in more traditional engineering disciplines. 6. Laboratory skills and hands-on experience. Critical skills that molecular engineers must acquire as part of their educational program include the ability to apply knowledge of mathematics, science, and engineering and the ability to design and conduct experiments, as well as the ability to analyze and interpret data. Molecular Engineering majors develop these skills through lab components associated with required courses in the physical and biological sciences, Molecular Engineering courses including MENG 26101-26102 Transport Phenomena I: Forces + Flows; Transport Phenomena II, MENG 26201-26202 Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics I-II, MENG 29500 Engineering Design, and some of the advanced electives such as MENG 27300 Polymer Physics and Engineering. We also anticipate that many Molecular Engineering students will receive advanced laboratory experience pursuing undergraduate research projects. 7. Non-technical skills. Many decades of workshops and panels engaging stakeholders in academia and industry, often associated with the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET), have identified criteria for outcomes of students in accredited engineering education programs. Although there is no thought of seeking ABET accreditation for the Molecular Engineering major, many ABET criteria, particularly those related to non-technological skills, are viewed as essential to incorporate into the Molecular Engineering major. Examples of student outcomes that fall into this category include: (a) an ability to formulate or design a system, process, or program to meet desired needs, (b) an ability to function on multidisciplinary teams, (c) an understanding of professional and ethical responsibility, (d) an ability to communicate effectively, (e) the broad education necessary to understand the impact of solutions in a global and societal context, (f) a recognition of the need for and an ability to engage in life-long learning, and (g) a knowledge of contemporary issues. Many of these outcomes will be addressed through both the Molecular Engineering degree curriculum (emphasized in the design sequence and the research colloquium) and the College general education requirements. Students who are able to both develop and articulate these skills will be positioned favorably for employment in industry and for postgraduate study (engineering, medicine, law, and business administration). Entering the Program Students must indicate their intent to pursue the BS program at the end of the Autumn Quarter in their second year of study by completing the Intent to Pursue Molecular Engineering questionnaire (available on the IME website). They begin the engineering curriculum in the following Spring Quarter with enrollment in either MENG 26010 Engineering Principles of Conservation or MENG 26020 Engineering Electrodynamics. Both courses require the completion of their stated prerequisites. Students should work with their advisers early in their first year of study to plan for those prerequisites to be completed in a timely manner.

The overall objective of the program is to provide basic engineering tools and ways of thinking to students that augment scientific approaches and problem solving skills. Minor Program Requirements Before a student can declare the minor in molecular engineering, the student must: Complete the general education requirements in mathematics and physical or biological sciences Earn a B or higher in MENG 20000 Introduction to Emerging Technologies Following completion of the general education requirements and MENG 20000 Introduction to Emerging Technologies (with a grade of B or better), students may apply to the director of undergraduate studies of the Institute for Molecular Engineering for admission into the minor in molecular engineering program. A student must receive the director of undergraduate studies’ approval of the minor program on a form obtained from the student's College adviser. Once signed by the director, this form must then be returned to the student's College adviser by the end of Spring Quarter of the student's third year. To earn the minor in molecular engineering, a student must complete five molecular engineering courses chosen in consultation with the director of undergraduate studies. Before meeting with the director, students should invest some thought into which courses they would like to complete for the minor and how those courses relate as a set. MENG 20000 Introduction to Emerging Technologies and MENG 29700 Undergraduate Research for Molecular Engineering must be among the five courses counted toward the minor. In rare cases, courses offered by other departments and programs may be approved by the director of undergraduate studies as substitutes for courses listed above. Courses in the minor program may not be (1) double counted with the student's major(s) or with other minors, or (2) counted toward general education requirements. Courses in the minor must be taken for quality grades, and more than half of the requirements for the minor must be met by registering for courses bearing University of Chicago course numbers. Summary of Requirements for the Minor in Molecular Engineering MENG 20000 Introduction to Emerging Technologies * 100 MENG 29700 Undergraduate Research for Molecular Engineering 100 Three additional courses in Molecular Engineering or other programs ** 300 Total Units 500 * With a grade of B or higher ** Courses not in Molecular Engineering must be approved by the director of undergraduate studies. Grading In order to qualify for the BS degree, a GPA of 2.0 or higher (with no grade lower than C-) is needed in all courses required in the major. Students majoring in Molecular Engineering must receive quality grades in all courses required in the degree program. All courses in the minor must be taken for quality grades. Nonmajors and nonminors may take Molecular Engineering courses on a P/F basis; only grades of C- or higher constitute passing work. Honors Students who pursue a substantive research project with a faculty member of the Institute for Molecular Engineering are encouraged to write and defend an honors thesis based on their work. Students who wish to be considered for honors are expected to complete their arrangements with the director of undergraduate studies before the end of their third year and to register for one quarter of MENG 29700 Undergraduate Research for Molecular Engineering during their third or fourth years. To be eligible to receive honors, students in the BS degree program must write a creditable honors paper describing their research. The paper must be submitted before the deadline established by the director of undergraduate studies and must be approved by the department chairperson. In addition, an oral presentation of the research is required. The research paper or project used to meet this requirement may not be used to meet the BA/BS paper or project requirement in another major. To earn a BS degree with honors in Molecular Engineering, students must also have an overall GPA of 3.0 or higher. Molecular Engineering Courses MENG 20000.

Disease is a major factor in evolution; individuals who are relatively resistant to disease are the ones who survive and reproduce, and who transmit their genes to the next generation. Throughout most of human history, nutritional deficiencies and infectious diseases were probably the major cause of infant and childhood mortality and thus were important factors in natural selection in humans. Culture has greatly altered the human environment, providing us with new but sometimes toxic foods, exposing us to new infectious diseases, and creating other conditions for which our evolutionary heritage has poorly prepared us. We will examine the evolutionary principles and genetic mechanisms that inform our understanding of disease and will discuss the interplay between biological and cultural factors in the etiology of disease.|Robert Perlman|Arranged ARR|Natsci-1: Darwinian Medicine|1|[40719]|[]|SEM

More discoveries and ideas are likely to come over the next 15 years. After thoroughly developing the Big Bang framework, this course will turn to the ideas that are central to the New Cosmology, the successor to the Big Bang theory. At the heart of the New Cosmology are the deep connections between the inner space of elementary particles and the outer space of cosmology. Inspired by those connections, the course will focus on dark matter, dark energy, the destiny of the universe, the origin of (ordinary) matter, cosmic inflations, and the multiverse.|Michael Turner|Arranged ARR|The New Cosmology|1|[40723]|[]|SEM

C is in many ways the lingua franca of computing, and a broad range of programming languages and related technologies derive from the basic principles of C memory management, control flow, and abstraction. Though there are many subtleties, C is not a big language, and it is expected that students will leave the course with a relatively deep understanding of the key concepts, which will then form a solid foundation for studying higher-level technologies. At the same time, C itself remains a very practical language, particularly so in areas such as scientific programming, high-performance computing, application level library design, systems programming, network programming, multi-threaded programming, etc. Students who successfully complete the course will be well prepared for subsequent MPCS courses in these areas. The course studies both fundamental and advanced C language constructs in the abstract and reinforces them through a range of exercies in the design of basic and advanced data structures, rudiemntary algorithms, and API design.|Dries Kimpe|Ryerson Phys Lab 276|C Programming|1|[42983]|[]|LEC

Software engineers must be familiar with cloud computing technologies since many new applications they develop will be deployed “in the cloud”, and existing applications will often require integration with cloud-hosted services to take advantage of new capabilities. This course provides an introduction to cloud computing with specific consideration for application development in two contexts: highly scalable (or so-called “web-scale”) web applications, and enterprise applications in a hybrid environment comprising both on-premises and cloud infrastructure. We will focus primarily on infrastructure and platform services, and will introduce software-as-a-service from the perspective of a consuming application. The course will emphasize practical applications of cloud computing technologies, with sufficient exploration of their theoretical underpinnings to inform architectural, design, and implementation decisions.|Vas Vasiliadis|Ryerson Phys Lab 276|Cloud Computing|1|[42987]|[]|LEC

We start by showing how to model relational databases using the prevailing technique for conceptual modeling -- Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD). Concepts covered include entity sets and relationships, entity key as a unique identifier for each object in an entity set, one-one, many-one, and many-many relationships as well as translational rules from conceptual modeling (ERD) to relational table definitions. We also examine the relational model and functional dependencies and their application to the methods for improving database design: normal forms and normalization. After design and modeling, students will learn the universal language of relational databases: SQL (Structured Query Language). We start by introducing relational algebra -- the theoretical foundation of SQL. Then we examine in detail the two aspects of SQL: data definition language (DDL) and the data manipulation language (DML). Concepts covered include subqueries (correlated and uncorrelated), aggregation, various types of joins including outer joins and syntax alternatives.

MSCA320051[44183]|Graduate|Closed|MSCA32005|TBA|One of the most actively developing areas of analytics is the real time analytics because of the growing number of data sources capable of collecting data round the clock in ever-larger amounts and with more complex structure; penetration of smart sensors everywhere where data collection used to be not possible, from micro to macro world and into hostile environments unsuitable for human observers; increasing demand for decisions made at latencies below human reaction time. Conducting real time analysis is different from the traditional data analysis in batch mode. Streaming data makes the very concept of sample nonexistent. Usual static sample characteristics, like p-value turn into dynamically changing processes. The old statistical concept of sufficient statistics may be getting a whole new meaning in the context of streaming data. The focus of the course is on stochastic methods suitable for real time analysis and their statistical implementations. Students will work with real data streaming live from the course server. We will learn about stochastic processes observed at random times and apply them to problems of monitoring, early event detection, prediction and control. Students are expected to be comfortable enough with R to write software for processing and responding to streaming data.|Staff|TBA|Real Time Analytics|1|[44183]|[]|LEC

Bayesian analysis is especially important because it naturally allows updating the probability for a model or hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available. This property of Bayesian approach plays significant role in dynamic analysis of a sequences of data. Applications of Bayesian analysis have exploded in recent period thanks to advances in computing techniques that made Bayesian approaches like Gibbs sampling, Markov Chain Monte Carlo, Dirichlet processes the main tools for advanced machine learning.

But how do hierarchies of value form in the first place? This course explores how canons crystallized in nineteenth-century Europe (with topics such as monumentality, art-religion, and highbrow/lowbrow) and how this history has left traces in arts culture today (such as debates over Venezuela’s El Sistema, culture wars, and the “great books” that have shaped the UChicago Core). While canons have been the subject of heated debate in the humanities, the central aim of this course is not polemical but cultural-historical: to understand how values take root, by whom (and for whom) they are cultivated, and the ideas or actions that give them such extraordinary staying-power.|Abigail Fine|Goodspeed Hall 205|Beethoven or Bust:  Musical Canon-Building in 19th Century Culture|1|[53259]|[]|LEC

While Stravinsky makes use of oral tradition and folk culture, our other examples will be drawn from classic literary works, primarily from the 19th century. We will integrate close textual readings with focused analyses of the musical pieces, while devoting considerable attention to contexts of composition and reception. Throughout, we will be concerned with cultural and socio-political events from the mid-19th century to the fall of Soviet Union—events that colored the performance and interpretation of these works and often set the tone for their composition as well.|Miriam Tripaldi|TBA|Russian Literature in the Composer's Ear|1|[55356]|[]|SEM

In this course, we will look—and listen—closely to four differing musicals from the 20th century, studying their creative origins, while also analyzing their complex social meanings revealed through the story, music, lyrics, staging, and dance.

Readings drawn from the current theoretical literature will introduce students to a range of analytical methods, most of which fall outside the purview of the “canonical” graduate music analysis classes in the music curriculum (i.e., Music 31100–31300). In our weekly analytical work we will seek a balance between comparative breadth—drawing on multiple analytical methods—and mastery of specific analytical techniques. Our aim will be to embrace plural methodologies while at the same time honing our critical and evaluative capacities; indeed, we will be especially interested in exploring the status of analytical validity and “criteria of correctness” (Dunsby) in a pluralistic methodological field. Another central theme will be the “multimedia” of academic music analysis: the interaction of sound, text, image, and performance in the effective communication of analytical insight. Repertories addressed will include early music, non-Western repertories (centering especially on the recent work of Tenzer, Roeder, et al), and popular music, in addition to more familiar common-practice fare.

This course will examine the musical transposition of literary works in Mussorgsky, Tchaikovsky, Rimsky-Korsakov, Stravinsky, Shostakovich, Prokofiev and Shchedrin. While Stravinsky makes use of oral tradition and folk culture, our other examples will be drawn from classic literary works, primarily from the 19th century. We will integrate close textual readings with focused analyses of the musical pieces, while devoting considerable attention to contexts of composition and reception. Throughout, we will be concerned with cultural and socio-political events from the mid-19th century to the fall of Soviet Union—events that colored the performance and interpretation of these works and often set the tone for their composition as well.|Miriam Tripaldi|TBA|Russian Literature in the Composer's Ear|1|[55357]|[]|SEM

NEHC201551[43169]|Undergraduate|Open|NEHC20155|Tue Thu : 10:30 AM-11:50 AM|Generally speaking, the ancient kingdom of Great Armenia is a marginal entity within the fields of ancient history and archaeology, which attracted relatively few historians of antiquity. As a matter of fact, scholars of Antiquity usually refer to Armenia only when it was involved into one of the frequent military crises between East and West. The country had an important strategic position, a vast expanse of territory, and wealthy natural resources. This explains very well the efforts of the Seleucids and of Rome, and of the Iranian dynasties of the Parthians and the Sassanids, to establish a military control and cultural influence over Armenia. Both contacts with the West and the East shaped the complex identity of Armenia - a somewhat mixed identity which is rather difficult to study. Therefore, both Classical and Iranian scholars tend to neglect the role of Armenia, or to diminish its position in the balance of power: the anachronistic cliché of a Greater Armenia as a «buffer state» is still mentioned. Accordingly, the few specialists on pre-Christian Armenia hardly communicate with those other scholars. Therefore, the very marginality of the kingdom of Armenia has not stimulated neither Classical scholars, nor Iranian scholars, to show interest in Armenia as well. This course will present a comprehensive history of ancient Armenia, from its origins to the fall of the kingdom in 428 CE, in order to reconstruct the history of the Artaxiad and of the Arsacid dynasties within a geopolitical frame considering the role of Armenia between Rome and Iran.”|Giusto Traina|TBA|A Political History of the Ancient Kingdom of Greater Armenia (ca. 188 BCE – 428 CE)|1|[43169]|[]|SEM

NEHC205731[42378]|Undergraduate|Open|NEHC20573|Mon Wed : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM|How and why do national identities provoke the deep emotional attachments that they do? In this course we try to understand these emotional attachments by examining the narrative of loss and redemption through which most nations in the Balkans retell their Ottoman past. We begin by considering the mythic temporality of the Romantic national narrative while focusing on specific national literary texts where the national past is retold through the formula of original wholeness, foreign invasion, Passion, and Salvation. We then proceed to unpack the structural role of the different elements of that narrative. With the help of Žižek’s theory of the subject as constituted by trauma, we think about the national fixation on the trauma of loss, and the role of trauma in the formation of national consciousness. Specific theme inquiries involve the figure of the Janissary as self and other, brotherhood and fratricide, and the writing of the national trauma on the individual physical body. Special attention is given to the general aesthetic of victimhood, the casting of the victimized national self as the object of the “other’s perverse desire.” With the help of Freud, Žižek, and Kant we consider the transformation of national victimhood into the sublimity of the national self. The main primary texts include Petar Njegoš’ Mountain Wreath (Serbia and Montenegro), Ismail Kadare’s The Castle (Albania), Anton Donchev’s Time of Parting (Bulgaria).|Angelina Ilieva|Stuart Hall 104|The Burden of History: The Nation and Its Lost Paradise|1|[42378]|[]|LEC

NEHC206471[43157]|Undergraduate|Closed|NEHC20647|Tue Thu : 10:30 AM-11:50 AM|This course examines the trajectory of Islamic political thought from the nineteenth century to the present day. Through a close study of key texts in this tradition, we will investigate how Islam has remained a vital source of principles and doctrines for a diverse array of political thinkers and movements over the course of the past two centuries. Developments in Islamic thought will be considered in the context of global trends, from the rise of liberalism, nationalism, and socialism to the liberation movements of the twentieth century and the confusion sewn by humanitarian crises of an unprecedented scale. Amidst these dramatic shifts in the geopolitical landscape, how have Muslim thinkers sought to ground their demands for dignity, autonomy, justice, and recognition? What do such claims have to do with the pursuit of personal and collective piety, on the one hand, and spiritual transcendence, on the other? Rather than framing Muslim political thinkers as reacting to global modernity, we understand them as key actors in shaping it, and our study of their writings will be oriented toward achieving a better understanding of the modern era as a whole. Our primary readings will take us from Istanbul, London, and the Nile Delta to Chicago, Tehran, and beyond, while our secondary texts will offer historical background and theoretical and theological context for the thinkers we focus on. The course aims to equip students to explore the Islamic tradition of political thought on their own. All required readings will be made available in English; the ability to read texts in their original languages of authorship (Arabic, Persian, Turkish, Urdu, French, etc.) is useful but not necessary.

Turkey and Israel are two of the three ""others"" of the Middle East (the third being Iran). While different in many respects, such as physical size, geographic location, dominant religion and demographic composition, these states also share important similarities that distinguish them from the rest of the predominantly Arab Middle East region. Both Israel and Turkey have historically embraced a strong orientation towards the West in their national ethos and security ties, and have complicated relationships with their immediate Arab and Muslim neighbors. Both exercise democratic practices at the procedural level but have recently been experiencing a serious erosion of substantive aspects of democracy, particularly with regards to the protection of freedoms and rights and the erosion of democratic institutions. Both are composed of prevailing ethnoreligious groups and religious and ethnic minorities that challenge the dominant structure from within and at their borders. Most importantly, both Turkey and Israel have undergone considerable societal, institutional and political reorientation in recent years which stimulate reevaluation of alleged “truths” about their character, functioning and democratic performance."|Aviad Rubin|TBA|Turkish and Israeli Politics: Modern Foundations and Contemporary Trends|1|[43163]|[]|LEC

The broad historical periodization will cover late Ottoman Syria, French colonial rule following World War I, the years of instability following Syrian independence, and “stability” under the Assad household. This course will also discuss the rise of Syrian national and broader pan-Arab consciousness, Islamic revivalism, and armed revolt. Concurrent with our survey of Syrian history, this course will also progress chronologically through the Syrian conflict and leverage the history learned along the way as a lens through which we contextualize and analyze the ongoing crisis. No prior knowledge of the Middle East is required and this course is open to both undergraduate and graduate students. Additional Notes: This course is a mix of lectures and regular student participation. Students will be asked to select a particular aspect of Syrian history (e.g. the Kurdish community, refugees, militant activity, etc.) that they are interested in researching and presenting brief updates on throughout the course. As such, students will be expected to supplement the syllabus with outside historical works. This course also has a weekly discussion section on Fridays where we will discuss and analyze primary sources written or translated into English.|Julio Rivera|TBA|History of Modern Syria|1|[43146]|[{'sectionname': 'Section 1D01 [43147] - DIS Open', 'instructor': 'Rivera', 'daytime': 'Fri : 11:30 AM-12:20 PM'}]|LEC

Normally studied in its Roman context, the expansion of the religion East of the Euphrates raises the problem of how Christian communities developed without a Constantine, that is, within a non-Christian, Zoroastrian empire. The seminar will provide an introduction to recent scholarship, literary sources in a variety of Near Eastern languages, and the archaeology of ecclesiastical institutions. It will debate how Christians adapted to an Iranian political, social, and economic order and how Zoroastrian elites accommodated them, as well as the attendant consequences for the histories of Iran and Christianity alike.|Richard Payne|TBA|The Rise of Christianity in Iran|1|[43162]|[]|SEM
NEHC301551[43168]|Graduate|Open|NEHC30155|Tue Thu : 10:30 AM-11:50 AM|Generally speaking, the ancient kingdom of Great Armenia is a marginal entity within the fields of ancient history and archaeology, which attracted relatively few historians of antiquity. As a matter of fact, scholars of Antiquity usually refer to Armenia only when it was involved into one of the frequent military crises between East and West. The country had an important strategic position, a vast expanse of territory, and wealthy natural resources. This explains very well the efforts of the Seleucids and of Rome, and of the Iranian dynasties of the Parthians and the Sassanids, to establish a military control and cultural influence over Armenia. Both contacts with the West and the East shaped the complex identity of Armenia - a somewhat mixed identity which is rather difficult to study. Therefore, both Classical and Iranian scholars tend to neglect the role of Armenia, or to diminish its position in the balance of power: the anachronistic cliché of a Greater Armenia as a «buffer state» is still mentioned. Accordingly, the few specialists on pre-Christian Armenia hardly communicate with those other scholars. Therefore, the very marginality of the kingdom of Armenia has not stimulated neither Classical scholars, nor Iranian scholars, to show interest in Armenia as well. This course will present a comprehensive history of ancient Armenia, from its origins to the fall of the kingdom in 428 CE, in order to reconstruct the history of the Artaxiad and of the Arsacid dynasties within a geopolitical frame considering the role of Armenia between Rome and Iran.”|Giusto Traina|TBA|A Political History of the Ancient Kingdom of Greater Armenia (ca. 188 BCE – 428 CE)|1|[43168]|[]|SEM

NEHC305731[42379]|Graduate|Open|NEHC30573|Mon Wed : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM|How and why do national identities provoke the deep emotional attachments that they do? In this course we try to understand these emotional attachments by examining the narrative of loss and redemption through which most nations in the Balkans retell their Ottoman past. We begin by considering the mythic temporality of the Romantic national narrative while focusing on specific national literary texts where the national past is retold through the formula of original wholeness, foreign invasion, Passion, and Salvation. We then proceed to unpack the structural role of the different elements of that narrative. With the help of Žižek’s theory of the subject as constituted by trauma, we think about the national fixation on the trauma of loss, and the role of trauma in the formation of national consciousness. Specific theme inquiries involve the figure of the Janissary as self and other, brotherhood and fratricide, and the writing of the national trauma on the individual physical body. Special attention is given to the general aesthetic of victimhood, the casting of the victimized national self as the object of the “other’s perverse desire.” With the help of Freud, Žižek, and Kant we consider the transformation of national victimhood into the sublimity of the national self. The main primary texts include Petar Njegoš’ Mountain Wreath (Serbia and Montenegro), Ismail Kadare’s The Castle (Albania), Anton Donchev’s Time of Parting (Bulgaria).|Angelina Ilieva|Stuart Hall 104|The Burden of History: The Nation and Its Lost Paradise|1|[42379]|[]|LEC

This course will focus on a careful reading of the Greek text of the First Apology and (as time permits) the Second Apology, with attention to Justin's language and literary style. We will also concentrate on Justin as an early defender of and advocate for the Christian faith, the importance of his logos doctrine, his demonology, and his sacramental ideas and theology of worship.|David Martinez|Swift Hall 403|Justin Martyr|1|[54819]|[]|LEC

The goal is to give a good coverage of different genetic approaches as well as different aspects of neurobiology. Topics are organized by genetic approaches as the following: 1) Transgenic. 2) Gene targeting. 3) Gene replacement. 4) Conditional knockout. 5) Genetic and optical control of neural activity. 6) Transgenic facilitated imaging. 7) Forward genetics and genetic screening. The selection of a variety of papers throughout the course aims to cover different neural pathways, neurotransmitters, receptor/channel types, signaling pathways, and functional implications (learning, memory, addiction, development etc). Specific emphasis will be on the integration of molecular, cellular and systems level approaches in understanding behavior. Lecture time will be devoted to the genetic approaches. Students will present and discuss papers.

ORGB302501[43195]|Graduate|Open|ORGB30250|Tue Thu : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM|Chordate biology emphasizes the diversity and evolution of modern vertebrate life, drawing on a range of sources (from comparative anatomy and embryology to paleontology, biomechanics, and developmental genetics). Much of the work is lab-based, with ample opportunity to gain firsthand experience of the repeated themes of vertebrate body plans, as well as some of the extraordinary specializations manifest in living forms. The instructors, who are both actively engaged in vertebrate-centered research, take this course beyond the boundaries of standard textbook content.|Michael Ivor Coates|TBA|Chordates:  Evolution and Comparative Anatomy|1|[43195]|[]|LEC

The course lectures and readings will provide a rigorous examination of the interactions among pathogens, hosts and the environment that produce disease in diverse populations. In addition to the demographic characteristics and the behaviors of individuals that are associated with a high risk of infection, we will examine complex aspects of the environment as they pertain to disease transmission. These include poverty, globalization, social networks, public health, and racial and ethnic disparities. Methodologic approaches to infectious disease epidemiology that will be covered include traditional study designs, molecular epidemiology, social network analysis, modeling, and network science. Local and global approaches will be applied to case studies from the United States, Asia and Africa.|Michael David|BioSci Learning Center 218|Infectious Disease Epidemiology; Networks and Modeling|1|[40728]|[]|LEC
PBHS314141[43245]|Graduate|Open|PBHS31414|Tue : 09:00 AM-11:50 AM|From the day we are born til the day we die, we experience a gendered world that shapes our opportunities, our social interactions, and even our physical health and wellbeing. This course will provide an introduction to sociological perspectives on gender, physical and mental health, and medicine while also providing a deep interrogation of the social, institutional, and biological links between gender and health. We will discuss inequalities in morbidity, mortality, and health behaviors of women, men, and transgendered individuals from different race, ethnic, and class backgrounds, and we will use sociological concepts, theories, and methods to understand why these differences appear. Finally, we will examine how medicine as an institution and medical practices as organizations sometimes contribute to and combat gender inequality in health. By the end of the course, you will be familiar with social scientific perspectives on (1) gender, (2) mental and physical health, and (3) the practice of medicine, as well as some of the fundamental debates in current medical sociology and sociology of gender.|Anna Mueller|Rosenwald Hall 329|Gender, Health & Medicine|1|[43245]|[]|SEM

This course explores some of the common obstacles, dilemmas, and opportunities that emerge when government (and, in some cases, non-governmental actors) attempts to put a policy into effect. Focused on the United States, and drawing on case studies from poverty, crime, and education, we grapple with prevailing understandings of the implementation process, as well as the functions of bureaucracy, program evaluation, and social movements. Prerequisite(s): Second-year standing is recommended; attendance on the first day of class is required or registration is dropped.

Drawing sociological theories of labor and consumption, class, and capitalism into popular notions of taste, nutrition, and the “good farmer,” this course aims to answer questions of agrofood systems in a globalizing world. We will bring social scientific theory to bear on a series of case studies centering on the United States and its relationships with other places. Our driving questions and interdisciplinary readings will be animated by four themes: 1) ideological roots of food and farming, 2) causes and consequences of agricultural globalization, 3) challenges facing urban and rural food access, and 4) power dynamics of sustainable land use.|Amanda Lequieu|TBA|Eating a Global Environment: Critical Perspectives of Agrofood Systems|1|[58363]|[]|SEM

This course explores the emergence of the 'Middle East' as an object of inquiry; a place with a people and a culture set in opposition to the 'West'. It asks how these categories are constituted, by whom, and with what consequence. How do they define the contours of political community, the possibilities for empathy and understanding or the limits of rights and moral obligation? The historical and contemporary texts assigned draw attention to the layered and shifting meanings of these categories, and in turn to the geopolitical and epistomological worlds that give rise to them. By putting these texts into conversation with each other the course engages a number of key issues that have occupied social theorists: the relationship between power and knowledge, the politics of representation, and the nature of social theory more generally.|Yaqub Hilal|TBA|Rethinking the Middle East|1|[43388]|[]|SEM

Over the course of the quarter, students will learn about theories on intergroup conflict and prejudice, how an individual's beliefs emerge from social contexts and shape their relationships with others, how obedience to authority is created and abused, and how social positioning and narratives influence conceptions of self and other.

PBPL288051[42235]|Undergraduate|Closed|PBPL28805|Tue Thu : 12:00 PM-01:20 PM|The standard theory of rational choice exhibits explanatory power in a vast range of circumstances, including such disparate decision making environments as whether to commit a crime, have children, or seek to emigrate. Nonetheless, shortfalls from full rationality seem not to be uncommon, and are themselves, to some extent, systematic. Behavioral economics documents and tries to account for these departures from full rationality. This course looks at areas in which some modification of the traditional rational choice apparatus might most be warranted; these include decisions that unfold over time, involve low probability events, or implicate willpower. To what extent should public policy respond to shortfalls from rationality or concern itself with promoting happiness?|James A Leitzel|TBA|Behavioral Economics and Policy|1|[42235]|[]|DIS
PBPL288201[42236]|Undergraduate|Open|PBPL28820|Thu : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|The goal of this course is to make students better producers and consumers of machine learning tools designed to help solve public policy problems. One thing this goal requires is some understanding of the basics of machine learning: how it works, what makes it different from the usual sort of statistical and econometric tools that we tend to use in social science studies of public policy problems, and how to implement these prediction models (which we will be doing in R, a free statistical program that now includes many machine learning packages). But this goal also requires some understanding of issues that are outside the usual machine learning toolkit, such as: what sorts of public policy problems are right for these tools, and which are not; how do we know whether a new prediction tool is capable of actually improving policy decisions, not just predicting outcomes accurately within some hold-out set; what additional considerations around fairness and other normative values may arise in using machine learning tools for public policy applications; and what challenges are associated with getting policymakers, front-line practitioners or individual citizens to make use of prediction tools and resulting decision aids.|Jens Ludwig|TBA|Machine Learning and Policy|1|[42236]|[]|LEC

We will spend the first half of the course exploring the implementation and evaluation of the programs that make up the traditional safety net for poor Americans: income supports, health insurance, and housing assistance. We will spend the rest of the quarter exploring topics that complicate the traditional social policy regime, including how the safety net is more robust for some groups, such as the elderly and veterans, than others. We will explore how the legal systems of immigration and incarceration hamper anti-poverty policy and how safety net programs address the needs of rural and Native Americans. Finally, we will investigate two recent developments in the field: social entrepreneurship and the critique of procedural rights.|Andrew Hammond|TBA|Poverty Law & Policy Reform|1|[42237]|[]|SEM

The seminar will cover a number of critical subjects: the difference between leadership and management; the development of the organization’s sense of mission and the strategy to achieve it; organizational culture; building and leading a team; entrepreneurial leadership; organizational transformation; leading an organization through crisis; how a leader relates to an organization’s governing body and external constituencies; how leaders are held accountable.

The main aim of this course will be to arrive at a reading of it that (1) situates it in the context of earlier philosophers’ writings about selves, memory, and consciousness, (2) is informed by an understanding of Locke’s own views concerning substance, consciousness, and memory, among other things, (3) carefully considers objections that later writers—most famously Butler and Reid—made to Locke’s theory. In this endeavor, we’ll be aided by two excellent recent books: Udo Theil’s The Early Modern Subject (2011) and Matthew Stuart’s Locke’s Metaphysics (2013).

It's also a lot of fun. In this course, we will consider the nature and significance of play, with a particular focus on the distinctively human form of play called games. The course will focus on three interrelated themes. (1) What are play and games? Drawing on thinkers like Johan Huizinga, Roger Caillois, and Bernard Suits, we will develop a vocabulary that allows us to tackle this question analytically, and to draw salient distinctions between kinds of play and games. We will also ask why humans and other animals play, and what form the answer to that question should take. (2) What is the value of playing? Sen and Nussbaum classify play as one of the basic human capabilities. Suits argues that playing games is central to the ideal human life. In investigating the significance of play to human life, we will also consider the ethics and aesthetics of playing. (3) How can thinking about play cast light on other human activities? Wittgenstein famously talks about linguistic activity in terms of games. Rawls uses games to think more generally about rule-governed institutions. And Huizinga argues that both artistic and religious activities are structurally indistinguishable from play. Could play be even more central to human experience than we suppose?|David Egan|TBA|The Philosophy of Play and Games|1|[53463]|[]|SEM
PHIL243011[42924]|Undergraduate|Open|PHIL24301|Tue : 12:00 PM-02:50 PM|One can distinguish four ways in which science and aesthetics are related during the period since the Renaissance. First, science has been the subject of artistic representation, in painting and photography, in poetry and novels (e.g., in Byron’s poetry, for example). Second, science has been used to explain aesthetic effects (e.g., Helmholtz’s work on the way painters achieve visual effects or musicians achieve tonal effects). Third, aesthetic means have been used to convey scientific conceptions (e.g., through illustrations in scientific volumes or through aesthetically affective and effective writing). Finally, philosophers have stepped back to consider the relationship between scientific knowing and aesthetic comprehension (e.g., Kant, Bas van Fraassen); much of the discussion of this latter will focus on the relation between images and what they represent. In this lecture-discussion course we will consider all of these aspects of the science-aesthetic connection.|Robert Richards|TBA|Science and Aesthetics in the 18th-21st Centuries|1|[42924]|[]|SEM

The perceived fissure between the “Two Cultures” has been deepened by the fact that the bulk of all history and philosophy of science has been devoted to the natural sciences. This seminar addresses the history and epistemology of what in the nineteenth century came to be called the “sciences” and the “humanities” since the Renaissance from an integrated perspective. The historical sources will focus on shared practices in, among others, philology, natural history, astronomy, and history.

PHIL343011[42925]|Graduate|Open|PHIL34301|Tue : 12:00 PM-02:50 PM|One can distinguish four ways in which science and aesthetics are related during the period since the Renaissance. First, science has been the subject of artistic representation, in painting and photography, in poetry and novels (e.g., in Byron’s poetry, for example). Second, science has been used to explain aesthetic effects (e.g., Helmholtz’s work on the way painters achieve visual effects or musicians achieve tonal effects). Third, aesthetic means have been used to convey scientific conceptions (e.g., through illustrations in scientific volumes or through aesthetically affective and effective writing). Finally, philosophers have stepped back to consider the relationship between scientific knowing and aesthetic comprehension (e.g., Kant, Bas van Fraassen); much of the discussion of this latter will focus on the relation between images and what they represent. In this lecture-discussion course we will consider all of these aspects of the science-aesthetic connection.|Robert Richards|TBA|Science and Aesthetics in the 18th-21st Centuries|1|[42925]|[]|SEM

Originally published in 1943, it is one of Strauss’s most intransigent essays.

Metaphysics Θ is given over in large measure to (ii), though it proceeds alert to the role of (i) as well. We will proceed in two phases. In the first phase, we will work minutely through every chapter save the last of Metaphysics Θ, attending closely to the text—elucidating, interpreting, and assessing. In the second phase, we will work through the same text again, now thematically, primarily with a view to understanding four interconnected issues: the natures of potentiality and actuality; the priority of actuality; the role of the modalities in the science of being qua being; and the broader relation between the modalities and categorialism. Naturally these sorts of questions will be in view in our first pass through the text, but we will largely hold them in abeyance until the second pass, we will also make freer use of the entire Aristotelian corpus in our discussions. No knowledge of Greek is required, though I will gladly arrange an informal reading group associated with the seminar for those participants interested in working through key passages in the original.

A challenging next step is to find planets as small as the Earth in orbit around stars like the Sun. The architecture of planetary systems reflects the formation of the parent star and its protoplanetary disk, and how these have changed with time. This course will review the techniques for discovery of planets around other stars, what we have learned so far about exoplanetary systems, and the driving questions for the future, including the quest for habitable environments elsewhere. Although quantitative analysis will be an important part of the course, students will not be expected to employ mathematics beyond algebra.

It is meant to enable critical evaluation of statements of fact and cause in discussions of the polity, economy, and society. One aim is to improve students' ability to produce original research, perhaps in course papers or a senior thesis. A second objective is to improve students' ability to evaluate claims made by others in scholarship, commentary, or public discourse. The specific research tools that the course develops are statistical, but the approach is more general. It will be useful as a guide to critical thinking whether the research to be evaluated, or to be done, is quantitative or not.

As we read through these works, we will also take up the wider historical and political context—e.g., the fifth-century rise of Athenian democracy and imperialism—and the relationship between our texts and other genres, including philosophy, drama, and rhetoric. The aim of the course is not only to give students a close familiarity with our two authors and some of the scholarship surrounding them, but also, more broadly, to think through the relationship between political theory and history. How might political theory guide the writing of history, and how can history contribute to theorizing politics?

But what do these concepts really mean—and how much of a difference do they really make? We'll begin by considering the ways in which fears of tyrannical, arbitrary, unaccountable rule have long been central to democratic political thought and practice. But we'll spend most of our time on contemporary issues and problems. How should we conceive of accountability, both conceptually and normatively? Are elections sufficient to make politicians accountable to ordinary citizens? What forms of accountability are appropriate for modern democratic politics? Is accountability only for elites, or should ordinary citizens be accountable to one another? In what contexts are transparency and accountability valuable, and when might we instead find their operation counter-productive and troubling? In addition to philosophical readings, we consider a variety of real-world cases, from Wikileaks to Truth and Reconciliation Commissions."|Matthew Landauer|TBA|Democratic Accountability and Transparency|1|[41779]|[]|LEC

In Latin America, however, even as almost all nations have democratized and economies have grown, clientelism continues to play an important role in mobilizing voters. This course will use several nations in Latin America, including Mexico, Argentina, and Peru to illustrate why clientelism has survived; how both politicians and parties use it; and some of its consequences for politics, especially representation. This course will use both classic readings as well as more modern scholarly work. By studying clientelism in Latin America, one is able to understand politics in developing nations in a more profound way.|Joy Langston|Psychology K114|Clientelism and Elections in Latin America|1|[41586]|[]|SEM

What does it take to get elected? What does it take to do the job? Can we predict whether a candidate will be a good president? We will discuss presidential leadership as a function of character and experience, institutional constraints, the selection process, and the domestic and global political context. We will evaluate recent presidential candidates such as Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, Ted Cruz, and Bernie Sanders using insights from the academic literature on the presidency. Finally, we will ask how much the individual who occupies the office can bring about change, given the political and institutional context of American government.

At the end of the twentieth century, the predominant view was that democracy had triumphed over fascism and communism and was secure in its standing as the sole legitimate mode of modern politics. Political theorists skeptical of this view argued that what had triumphed was not properly ‘democracy’ at all, often because political practice in modern democracies failed to measure up to a classical ideal. We will investigate uses of the ancient Greek past by modern critics of the theory and practice of liberal democratic politics. With a focus on post-war theorists like Hannah Arendt, Bernard Williams, and Pierre Hadot, we will ask how recovering aspects of the classical tradition might revitalize the modern theoretical and practical political landscape. By elucidating the political motivations behind, and implications of, the use of the ancient Greeks by these and other thinkers, we will clarify post-war critiques of the theory and practice of modern democratic politics that continue to influence theorists today.|Jared Holley|TBA|Democracy, Ancient and Modern|1|[41782]|[]|SEM

Reformers confronted weighty questions such as the political strategy most likely to bring about emancipation, the broader commitments on which arguments for abolition should be grounded, the attitude to adopt vis-à-vis oppressive state institutions, and the intersections between the fight for legal freedom and other rights and other movements. In this course, we will explore the political stakes and theoretical underpinnings of these debates. We will do so primarily through close readings of writings, speeches, essays, pamphlets, and short stories written by various antebellum actors and thinkers such as Frederick Douglass, George Fitzhugh, Frances Harper, Harriet Jacobs, Angelina Grimké, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, Herman Melville, Wendell Phillips, Lysander Spooner, Henry David Thoreau, and David Walker. Topics will include the language of natural right, one’s obligations toward government and human law, the emergence of capitalism, the justifiability of violence, gender in the antislavery struggle, and the Constitution’s relation to social change.|Daniel Nichanian|TBA|American Antislavery: Antebellum Political Thought and Political Strategy|1|[41783]|[]|SEM

In most democracies, the distribution of wealth among citizens is unequal but the right to vote is universal. Why then have so many newly democratic states transitioned under conditions of high inequality yet failed to redistribute? This course explores this puzzle by analyzing the mechanisms through which individual and group preferences can be translated into pro-poor policies, and the role elites play in influencing a government's capacity or incentives to redistribute wealth. Topics include economic inequality and the demand for redistribution, the difference in redistribution between democracy and dictatorship, the role of globalization in policymaking, and the effects of redistribution on political stability and change.|Michael Albertus|Pick Hall 506|Democracy and the Politics of Wealth Redistribution|1|[41784]|[]|SEM

We will analyze what governments do “behind closed doors” and learn about different theoretical approaches to understanding the production of secrecy, its effects on participants, and its consequences on issues like conflict and diplomacy. The course covers ten specific domains featuring secrecy, including secret state partnerships, closed-door crisis decision-making, secrecy during war, and the process of gathering and analyzing intelligence. Questions we will address include: What agreements do diplomats negotiate privately and why? For what ends do state use secrecy in wartime? What do covert cooperative partnerships look like and when do they succeed? What espionage practices do states use and how have they changed over time? Students will also gain experience doing their own research about secret statecraft via a research paper case study that showcases their own analysis of declassified materials.

The goals of the course are to teach students the statistical methods needed to pursue independent large-n research projects and to develop the skills necessary to pursue further methods training in the social sciences. Part I of the course reviews the simple linear model (as seen in STAT 22000 or its equivalent) with attention to the theory of statistical inference and the derivation of estimators. Basic calculus and linear algebra will be introduced. Part II extends the linear model to the multivariate case. Emphasis will be placed on model selection and specification. Part III examines the consequences of data that is ""poorly behaved"" and how to cope with the problem. Depending on time, Part IV will introduce special topics like systems of simultaneous equations, logit and probit models, time-series methods, etc. Little prior knowledge of math or statistics is expected, but students are expected to work hard to develop the tools introduced in class.

The course will be organized around an intensive engagement with two central texts: Herodotus’ Histories and Thucydides’ History of the Peloponnesian War. As we read through these works, we will also take up the wider historical and political context—e.g., the fifth-century rise of Athenian democracy and imperialism—and the relationship between our texts and other genres, including philosophy, drama, and rhetoric. The aim of the course is not only to give students a close familiarity with our two authors and some of the scholarship surrounding them, but also, more broadly, to think through the relationship between political theory and history. How might political theory guide the writing of history, and how can history contribute to theorizing politics?

Through careful study of the meaning and function of Arendt’s often-puzzling distinctions among “public,” “private” and “social” and among “labor,” “work,” and “action,” we’ll try to understand her account of the significance and prospects of human activity, including especially political activity, in modernity. Topics of special concern may include: the relation between philosophy and politics; Arendt's relationship to Marx and to the Marxist critique of capitalism; the meanings of work and leisure in the twentieth century and beyond; the nature and basis of political power and freedom; the relations between art and politics; the significance of city life for politics; and many others. While The Human Condition will be at the center of the course, the book will be supplemented and framed by other material, including essays on related subjects by Arendt; excerpts from some of the other thinkers with whom Arendt was in conversation; and material by later writers that will help us situate Arendt in the larger contexts of twentieth-century intellectual life, and which will also give us different angles on some of the key issues in Arendt’s book.

Originally published in 1943, it is one of Strauss’s most intransigent essays.

PLSC406051[41804]|Graduate|Open|PLSC40605|Thu : 09:00 AM-11:50 AM|This course builds on the canonical works in International Relations (IR) theory covered in PLSC 40600 (Seminar on International Relations Theory), leading students through ten weeks of recent debates in IR research organized along substantive and methodological lines. There is an intentional absence of thematic unity among the topics. Some units look more closely at recent debates within the classic paradigms (e.g. “the practice turn in constructivist research”) while others are not easily categorized along these lines (e.g. “emotions in IR”). Some focus on work across empirical domains that shares a recently popular methodological innovation (e.g. “the experimental turn in IR”); other topics are located closer towards the fringe of mainstream IR but showcase interesting and creative ways of doing our work (e.g. “spatial thinking in IR”). Specific topics will change with each offering and are chosen based on a combination of importance to the field, value as exemplars of creative and rigorous research, and my own personal interests. Participants will demonstrate fluency in these debates and develop opinions about their significance and staying power. A secondary goal is for students to expand their own research interests and draw lessons about how debates and fads evolve in IR to maximize the impact of their own work.

This graduate seminar will introduce students to the scholarly literature on redistribution, focusing primarily on recent work. We will study the causes and consequences of redistribution, focusing both on the institutions that shape incentives for governments to implement redistribution, as well as the mechanisms, actors, and international conditions that can erode government incentives or capabilities to redistribute. The emphasis of the course will be twofold: rigorously examining the inferences we can draw from existing work, and designing research that can contribute to a better understanding of the fundamental questions regarding redistributive policies.

This graduate seminar will introduce students to fundamental questions in the study of political regimes: What distinguishes democracy from dictatorship? How does the functioning of democratic institutions affect democratic survival? Why are some dictatorships more stable than others, and what role do institutions such as legislatures, parties, and elections play in their stability? What political and economic factors explain regime transitions, and why do transitions tend to cluster both spatially and temporally? The course will examine how these questions are addressed in current scholarship, with an emphasis on enabling students to design research projects that contribute to our understanding of how political regimes function, persist, and change.

PLSC448011[41846]|Graduate|Open|PLSC44801|Mon : 09:30 AM-12:20 PM|This course introduces students to the ongoing network turn in international political economy (IPE). It has three goals. First, students will replace purely metaphorical (and vague) talk of networks with focused propositions about the network properties and dynamics of contemporary phenomena such as international hierarchy, regional fragmentation amidst global integration, and the fate of sovereign territoriality in an age of (violent) transnational activism. Second, students will ponder competing explanations of the network turn in IPE: have IPE scholars abandoned conventional analytical tools in favor of network theory, because the conventional toolkit already came with rudimentary network-theoretic devices that simply needed sharpening; or did some changes in the real international economy prompt the shift? Finally, students will critically assess the ability of SNT to be a vehicle for innovative social science. They will do this, in part, by devising a research proposal of their own that assesses the validity and utility of testing a single network-theoretic proposition against some conventional competitor.|Matthias Staisch|Saieh Hall for Economics 242|Network Theory for International Political Economy|1|[41846]|[]|SEM

It is not a traditional course in comparative law, in that it focuses not so much on particular rules of substantive law but on the structure of different legal systems and the consequences of those structural differences for law and society. In particular, we will focus on the economic impact of legal traditions. Readings will be drawn from legal and social science literature, including works from anthropology, economics, political science and sociology. The course will explicitly cover non-Western legal traditions to an extent not found in conventional comparative law courses. Furthermore, American institutions are explicitly included in the comparison: this is not simply a course in foreign law.|Thomas Ginsburg|Laird Bell Quadrangle I|Comparative Legal Institutions|01|[54756]|[]|CRS

There are over $3.7 trillion in municipal bonds outstanding and on average over $350 billion issued each year. This annual amount represents 10,000 separate financings. This market is critical to investors and the 87,500 state and local governments in the United States that need to meet the needs of their respective citizens. There are 55,000 governments with debt outstanding. Each week we will cover different aspects of tax exempt bonds and the various processes used to raise money for governments and not for profits. The texts will be supplemented by rating agency reports, and topical articles from industry publications and publicly available web sites. Some classes will include guest speakers to illuminate a course subject and to point up career opportunities. The class will include a discussion how and where Master’s students in public policy can pursue various career options in the municipal bond industry including: working in a: budget or finance office of a government focusing on debt management; at a rating agency; working as an analyst for a mutual fund, insurance company or bank trust company; or working; or as an analyst for an investment banking firm or government advisory firm.

PPHA327201[43525]|Graduate|Closed|PPHA32720|TBA|This course is about imagining the future – and developing a plan to make it happen. We will combine the theoretical and the practical. We will think creatively and philosophically about what could be, and work concretely on how to build it. Government is, everywhere, an industry in serious trouble. Its consumers are disenchanted and looking for alternatives, its products are failing the tests of quality and innovation, and its cost structure is too high. If governments were private firms, they’d be facing the dual prospects of either a takeover to “rescue” them or death in the competitive marketplace as their customer base migrates to newer alternatives. And, in fact, governments today face precisely those challenges. The idea behind this course is to address the government biz as exactly that: a mismanaged industry, business entity, or brand. We will study the history of the modern state and theories of how it will evolve in coming decades. We will consider what this means for the institution of government and what exactly “government” is. And we will look at what this means for the potential of private-sector, non-profit, non-governmental and trans-governmental entities to compete with the nation-state and take over its functions – and the possibilities that government can compete back and perhaps expand its own “business” line. But the course is intended to produce not just deep-thinking and new theories, but also concrete business plans. Students will be expected to identify either a new business idea or product line for a government entity to launch or a current government function that a for-profit or non-profit business can undertake to compete successfully with the public sector – and then develop a detailed business plan. This will require analyzing market opportunities, carrying out financial projections, understanding the realities of program delivery, and crafting a winning message for investors and/or voters. This will allow students not just to study cutting-edge literature on political theory but also to hone their practical business skills – and perhaps even start a successful business.|Staff|TBA|The Future of Government|1|[43525]|[]|SEM

Individuals aim at choosing the best possible match given their preferences and the costs they face. This course will analyze the social and economic consequences of individuals matching behavior, with an emphasis on inequality, discrimination and segregation. In the marriage market, assortative mating tends to perpetuate human capital inequalities across generations. In the labor market, firms may prefer to hire white males rather than women or minorities. We will explore to what extent this can be explained by pure discrimination and whether affirmative action can lead to better outcomes.

The courses objective is to teach you how to use these tools well enough to feel comfortable evaluating the quality of program evaluations that you are likely to review during your careers. The course begins by examining the elements of a cost/benefit analysis. Some of the principles we discuss during this part of the course are identical to those used by managers in a private firm when they consider whether to invest in new plant or equipment, to train their workers, or to initiate new human resource practices. But it also is important to recognize the differences between cost-benefit analyses of social programs and of private sector investments. Here we examine how the concepts of consumer and producer surplus discussed in your economics courses guide us in formulating evaluation questions and choosing appropriate outcome measures. Most of the course examines the strategies for evaluating the impact that government policies have on alternative outcomes. The key question here is what would have been the outcome had individuals, neighborhoods, state, etc., not been exposed to the policy. The impact of the policy is the difference between the actual outcome and this counterfactual outcome. Much social science research demonstrates that obtaining credible estimates of these impacts can be difficult. During this part of the course, we discuss how to plausibly address some of the more common difficulties encountered by program evaluators.|Jeffrey Grogger|Public Policy 140C|Program Evaluation|1|[43531]|[]|LEC

The policy is said to be fair, to contribute to the common good, to promote our common values, etc. But what does this all mean? Can this appeal to values be in any way rational? By introducing the major families of contemporary theories of justice, this class will allow students to form an informed opinion with respect to what kind of justifications can be supported from the point of view of a theory of justice. We will establish the place of these theories of justice in the history of ideas and compare the different theories with respect to their main concepts.

Our exploration will combine theoretical and empirical papers to gain an appreciation for various theories of conceptual development and evaluate their ability to explain observed psychological phenomena.

PSYC231651[41236]|Undergraduate|Closed|PSYC23165|Wed : 09:30 AM-12:20 PM|The past decade saw an explosion of empirical research in the study of morality. Among the most exciting and novel findings and theories, evolutionary biologists and comparative psychologists have shown that moral cognition has evolved to facilitate cooperation and smooth social interactions, and that certain components of morality are present in non-human animals. Developmental psychologists came up with ingenious paradigms, demonstrating that the elements that underpin morality are in place much earlier than we thought, and clearly in place before children turn two. Social neuroscientists have begun to map brain circuits implicated in moral decision-making and identify the contribution of neuropetides to moral sensitivity. Changes in the balance of brain chemistry, or in connectivity between regions can cause changes in moral behavior. The lesson from all this new knowledge is clear: human moral behavior cannot be separated from human biology, its development, and past evolutionary history. As our understanding of the human brain improves, society at large, and justice and the law in particular, are and will be increasingly challenged. Discoveries in neuroscience will soon impact our legal system in ways that hopefully lead to a more cost-effective, humane and flexible system than we have today. The intent of this class is to provide an overview of the current research on the morality, and examine this topic from a range of relevant interdisciplinary perspectives.|Jean Decety|Psychology G117|Multidisciplinary Perspectives on Morality|1|[41236]|[]|SEM

PSYC240501[41028]|Undergraduate|Open|PSYC24050|Mon : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|"Thinking about the nature of wisdom goes back to the Greek philosophers and the classical religious sages, but the concept of wisdom has changed in many ways over the history of thought. While wisdom has received less scholarly attention in modern times, it has recently re-emerged in popular discourse with a growing recognition of its potential importance for addressing complex issues in many domains. But what is wisdom? It’s often used with a meaning more akin to ""smart"" or ""clever."" Is it just vast knowledge? This course will examine the nature of wisdom—how it has been defined, how its meaning has changed, and what its essential components might be. We will examine how current psychological theories conceptualize wisdom and consider whether, and how, wisdom can be studied scientifically; that is, can wisdom be measured and experimentally manipulated to illuminate its underlying mechanisms and understand its functions? Finally, we will explore how concepts of wisdom can be applied in business, education, medicine, the law, and in the course of our everyday lives. Readings will be drawn from a wide array of disciplines including philosophy, classics, history, psychology, behavioral economics, medicine, and public policy."|W.

This erudite Polish author is a prime 20th century modernist whose novels, entangled in an ongoing battle with fundamental questions and, indeed, with existence itself, explode with uncanny laughter. In contrast to many of his contemporary writers who established their reputation by applying existing philosophical models, Gombrowicz employed ironically his philosophical erudition, while engaging in his philosophical récit the literary and cultural tropes which derived from his Polish cultural heritage. Over the next ten weeks, we will investigate how he twisted these references and tropes to inform a distinctly Gombrowiczian version of performative philosophy. We will read Gombrowicz’s novels, lectures on philosophy and some of his autobiographical writings to seek answers to our overarching question: what makes this author a philosopher?|Bozena Shallcross|Foster Hall 408|Gombrowicz: The Writer as Philosopher|1|[42355]|[]|LEC
REES210061[42359]|Undergraduate|Open|REES21006|Mon Wed : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM|Course centers on Joseph Conrad’s The Secret Agent: A Simple Tale. Contemporary critics often consider this novel the archetypal fictional work about terrorism, as it is based on the bomb attack that occurred in Greenwich in 1888. The Secret Agent demonstrates, however, much more than its prophetic significance rediscovered after 9/11. Therefore, the course seeks how the novel’s relevance stems in equal measure from Conrad’s interest in a wider political process and his distrust of state power; in particular, the course explores how these forces determine the individual caught in a confining situation. We read The Secret Agent as a political novel, that struggle for solutions defies chaos as well as an imposition of a single ideology or one authorial point of view. Its ambiguities and political antinomies allow for interdisciplinary readings that also present an opportunity to critically overview the established approaches to main Conradian themes. In analyzing the formation of the narrative’s ideology we discuss Conrad’s historical pessimism that demonstrates with sustained irony how capitalism breeds social injustice that, in turn, breeds anarchism. The class also focuses on how the novel exposes duplicity in staging surveillance, terrorism, as well as adjacent forms of violence or sacrifice. Critical texts include several older but still influential readings (Jameson, Eagleton) and the most recent.|Bozena Shallcross|TBA|Joseph Conrad's The Secret Agent: (In)action, Surveillance, Terrorism|1|[42359]|[]|LEC

REES244151[42372]|Undergraduate|Open|REES24415|Tue Thu : 04:30 PM-05:50 PM|Isaiah Berlin described the notion of the Intelligentsia as “arguably Russia’s greatest contribution to world civilization.” But just how culturally specific—or, alternatively, universal—is that concept? Many of the chief theoretical concerns of the Intelligentsia (the role of the public intellectual in society, the expression of dissidence and the ethics of exile) have preoccupied thinkers since Socrates. What distinguishes the Intelligentsia from other models of public intellectualism? How have various Slavic public intellectuals maintained, or broken with, this tradition? In order to establish a theoretical vocabulary, the course will begin with an introduction to several classical and contemporary theories of the role of the intellectual in society. We will then ground our inquiry in the historical invention of the Russian Intelligentsia during the mid-19th Century before setting off to analyze its 20th and 21st-century manifestations. Throughout the course, our main goal will be to examine the ways in which these thinkers conceive of and perform the role of a “public intellectual.” How do they balance the tasks of documenting and participating in the historical events they describe? What strategies do they utilize in order to relay their intellectual activity to a larger public? What do they consider to be the responsibility of intellectuals?|Kaitlyn Tucker|TBA|The Intelligentsia:  On Slavic Social Thought|1|[42372]|[]|LEC

While Stravinsky makes use of oral tradition and folk culture, our other examples will be drawn from classic literary works, primarily from the 19th century. We will integrate close textual readings with focused analyses of the musical pieces, while devoting considerable attention to contexts of composition and reception. Throughout, we will be concerned with cultural and socio-political events from the mid-19th century to the fall of Soviet Union—events that colored the performance and interpretation of these works and often set the tone for their composition as well.|Miriam Tripaldi|TBA|Russian Literature in the Composer's Ear|1|[55355]|[]|SEM

In the early twentieth century the novel-memoir becomes arguably the foremost vehicle for literary modernism. We will examine the literary strategies used to represent the workings of memory and the construction of their autobiographical worlds. What role does tradition play in foregrounding the writers’ approach to their immediate familial and cultural past? How is the experience of time reconfigured by the processes of memory, and what rhetorical techniques are used to effect this in prose narratives? Readings may include James Joyce’s A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, Andrei Bely’s Kotik Letaev, Virginia Woolf’s To the Lighthouse, Osip Mandelshtam’s The Noise of Time and Vladimir Nabokov’s Speak, Memory, as well as selections from Boris Pasternak, Marcel Proust, Andrei Platonov, Marina Tsvetaeva and others. Supplementary readings will include texts by Sigmund Freud, Henri Bergson, Gérard Genette and Mikhail Bakhtin.

REES290131[42373]|Undergraduate|Open|REES29013|Mon Wed : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM|How and why do national identities provoke the deep emotional attachments that they do? In this course we try to understand these emotional attachments by examining the narrative of loss and redemption through which most nations in the Balkans retell their Ottoman past. We begin by considering the mythic temporality of the Romantic national narrative while focusing on specific national literary texts where the national past is retold through the formula of original wholeness, foreign invasion, Passion, and Salvation. We then proceed to unpack the structural role of the different elements of that narrative. With the help of Žižek’s theory of the subject as constituted by trauma, we think about the national fixation on the trauma of loss, and the role of trauma in the formation of national consciousness. Specific theme inquiries involve the figure of the Janissary as self and other, brotherhood and fratricide, and the writing of the national trauma on the individual physical body.

This erudite Polish author is a prime 20th century modernist whose novels, entangled in an ongoing battle with fundamental questions and, indeed, with existence itself, explode with uncanny laughter. In contrast to many of his contemporary writers who established their reputation by applying existing philosophical models, Gombrowicz employed ironically his philosophical erudition, while engaging in his philosophical récit the literary and cultural tropes which derived from his Polish cultural heritage. Over the next ten weeks, we will investigate how he twisted these references and tropes to inform a distinctly Gombrowiczian version of performative philosophy. We will read Gombrowicz’s novels, lectures on philosophy and some of his autobiographical writings to seek answers to our overarching question: what makes this author a philosopher?|Bozena Shallcross|Foster Hall 408|Gombrowicz: The Writer as Philosopher|1|[42358]|[]|LEC
REES310061[42363]|Graduate|Open|REES31006|Mon Wed : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM|Course centers on Joseph Conrad’s The Secret Agent: A Simple Tale. Contemporary critics often consider this novel the archetypal fictional work about terrorism, as it is based on the bomb attack that occurred in Greenwich in 1888. The Secret Agent demonstrates, however, much more than its prophetic significance rediscovered after 9/11. Therefore, the course seeks how the novel’s relevance stems in equal measure from Conrad’s interest in a wider political process and his distrust of state power; in particular, the course explores how these forces determine the individual caught in a confining situation. We read The Secret Agent as a political novel, that struggle for solutions defies chaos as well as an imposition of a single ideology or one authorial point of view. Its ambiguities and political antinomies allow for interdisciplinary readings that also present an opportunity to critically overview the established approaches to main Conradian themes. In analyzing the formation of the narrative’s ideology we discuss Conrad’s historical pessimism that demonstrates with sustained irony how capitalism breeds social injustice that, in turn, breeds anarchism. The class also focuses on how the novel exposes duplicity in staging surveillance, terrorism, as well as adjacent forms of violence or sacrifice. Critical texts include several older but still influential readings (Jameson, Eagleton) and the most recent.|Bozena Shallcross|TBA|Joseph Conrad's The Secret Agent: (In)action, Surveillance, Terrorism|1|[42363]|[]|LEC

In this course we try to understand these emotional attachments by examining the narrative of loss and redemption through which most nations in the Balkans retell their Ottoman past. We begin by considering the mythic temporality of the Romantic national narrative while focusing on specific national literary texts where the national past is retold through the formula of original wholeness, foreign invasion, Passion, and Salvation. We then proceed to unpack the structural role of the different elements of that narrative. With the help of Žižek’s theory of the subject as constituted by trauma, we think about the national fixation on the trauma of loss, and the role of trauma in the formation of national consciousness. Specific theme inquiries involve the figure of the Janissary as self and other, brotherhood and fratricide, and the writing of the national trauma on the individual physical body. Special attention is given to the general aesthetic of victimhood, the casting of the victimized national self as the object of the “other’s perverse desire.” With the help of Freud, Žižek, and Kant we consider the transformation of national victimhood into the sublimity of the national self. The main primary texts include Petar Njegoš’ Mountain Wreath (Serbia and Montenegro), Ismail Kadare’s The Castle (Albania), Anton Donchev’s Time of Parting (Bulgaria).|Angelina Ilieva|Stuart Hall 104|The Burden of History: The Nation and Its Lost Paradise|1|[42380]|[]|LEC

While common themes often emerge in terms of the ethical ideas used (justice, responsibility) or the subjects studied (species extinction, population, water, food, climate change, etc.), religious ethicists draw on a wide range of ethical methods, theories, and sources of authority to develop their environmental ethics. To illustrate this diversity we will explore several ethical methods as applied to environmental ethics. These approaches may include the use of the Bible, Church teachings, virtue ethics, and natural law theory in Eastern Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and Protestant environmental ethics; how the Islamic legal tradition can be applied to environmental issues; the use of prayer, meditation, and ethical analysis in Buddhist environmental ethics; the ethics of the nature religion of deep ecology; and/or the quest for a global environmental ethic as expressed in the Earth Charter initiative.|Sarah E.

Most of the course will examine how religious and philosophical ethical systems respond to the vast temporal and spatial scales of climate change and its inherent uncertainties. For instance, common principles of environmental ethics such as justice and responsibility are often reimagined in climate ethics. We will also explore the degree to which the assumptions of many modern Western ethical systems including linear causality, an emphasis on individuals, and purely rational decision-making foster or inhibit climate ethics.

Until today the appropriation of Byzantine style is especially evident in the church of Saint Mark the Evangelist, as well as in the decoration of less-well known medieval churches of the Venetian Lagoon. During the so-called Fourth Crusade, the Sack of Constantinople has led to large-scale pillaging of the Byzantine capital and the transfer to Venice of countless Byzantine artifacts, among them are liturgical items, reliquaries, icons, and architectural spoils. How were these artifacts employed in the Venetian Lagoon for religious and political ends after being disassociated from their original contexts? What transformations did they experience with regard to usage and appearance? What kinds of new ceremonies, both religious and secular, did they inspire? What was their impact on artistic creativity and religious life in their new environment? How were they perceived intellectually, and what kinds of narratives evolved around them in Venice over the centuries? These are some of the key questions to guide our research.

RLST240501[41029]|Undergraduate|Open|RLST24050|Mon : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM|"Thinking about the nature of wisdom goes back to the Greek philosophers and the classical religious sages, but the concept of wisdom has changed in many ways over the history of thought. While wisdom has received less scholarly attention in modern times, it has recently re-emerged in popular discourse with a growing recognition of its potential importance for addressing complex issues in many domains. But what is wisdom? It’s often used with a meaning more akin to ""smart"" or ""clever."" Is it just vast knowledge? This course will examine the nature of wisdom—how it has been defined, how its meaning has changed, and what its essential components might be. We will examine how current psychological theories conceptualize wisdom and consider whether, and how, wisdom can be studied scientifically; that is, can wisdom be measured and experimentally manipulated to illuminate its underlying mechanisms and understand its functions? Finally, we will explore how concepts of wisdom can be applied in business, education, medicine, the law, and in the course of our everyday lives. Readings will be drawn from a wide array of disciplines including philosophy, classics, history, psychology, behavioral economics, medicine, and public policy."|W.

The course not only introduces some theoretical and intermedial problems of adaptation of literature to film but also address cultural and political implications of Kurosawa’s adaptation of classic and foreign sources. We will study how Kurosawa’s turn to literary adaptation provided a vehicle for circumventing social taboos of his time and offered a screen for addressing politically sensitive and sometimes censored topics of Japan’s militarist past, war crimes, defeat in the Second World War, and ideological conflicts of reconstruction.

But it is as much a dogged search for objective grounds of expression and intelligibility amidst a sea of subjectivity: from Van Gogh's letters and Mallarme's poems to the new logical symbolism of Frege and the stream of consciousness of William James, the epoch saw an unprecedented effort to rationalize the private, the incommunicable, experience itself. This is a broad revisionist look at a transitional but key era in intellectual history, featuring some new material from the instructor's own work in progress."|Andrei Pop|Cochrane-Woods Art Ctr 153|Symbolism between University and Solipsism|1|[43973]|[]|SEM

Originally published in 1943, it is one of Strauss’s most intransigent essays. I shall also discuss “On Classical Political Philosophy” (1945), “The Spirit of Sparta or the Taste of Xenophon” (1939), and “Farabi’s Plato” (1945).|Heinrich Meier|Foster Hall 505|Leo Strauss on the Philosophic Life|1|[43986]|[]|SEM

First, science has been the subject of artistic representation, in painting and photography, in poetry and novels (e.g., in Byron’s poetry, for example). Second, science has been used to explain aesthetic effects (e.g., Helmholtz’s work on the way painters achieve visual effects or musicians achieve tonal effects). Third, aesthetic means have been used to convey scientific conceptions (e.g., through illustrations in scientific volumes or through aesthetically affective and effective writing). Finally, philosophers have stepped back to consider the relationship between scientific knowing and aesthetic comprehension (e.g., Kant, Bas van Fraassen); much of the discussion of this latter will focus on the relation between images and what they represent. In this lecture-discussion course we will consider all of these aspects of the science-aesthetic connection.|Robert Richards|TBA|Science and Aesthetics in the 18th-21st Centuries|1|[42926]|[]|SEM

In this course, we will look—and listen—closely to four differing musicals from the 20th century, studying their creative origins, while also analyzing their complex social meanings revealed through the story, music, lyrics, staging, and dance.

SOCI201921[42066]|Undergraduate|Open|SOCI20192|Tue Thu : 10:30 AM-11:50 AM|From at least the Renaissance until some time around the middle of the twentieth century, social class was the pre-eminent, generalized determinant of life chances in European and, eventually, American societies. Social class had great effect on one's social standing; economic well-being; political power; access to knowledge; and even longevity, health, and height. In that time, there was hardly an aspect of life that was not profoundly influenced by social class. In the ensuing period, the effects of social class have receded greatly, and perhaps have even vanished. In their place formal schooling has become the great generalized influence over who gets access to the desiderata of social life, including food, shelter, political power, and medical care.

This course makes sociological sense of this relationship, examining how cities “breed,” “need,” and “fight” these stereotypical urban ills. Students will explore these topics from a number of perspectives, including criminological theory, up-close accounts of the drug economy, and portraits of everyday life in today’s hyper-policed ghettos. Through a series of field assignments, students utilize theories and concepts from the course to analyze issues of deviance, crime, and criminal justice in Chicago.|Forrest Stuart|TBA|Crime and the City|1|[42068]|[]|SEM

In this course, we leverage sociological and social scientific concepts, theories and methods to examine how these inequalities in morbidity, mortality, and health behaviors develop and change across the life course from infancy to later life. We will pay particular attention to how individual characteristics (namely gender, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and sexual orientation, but also genetic vulnerabilities) interact with social-structural, institutional, and cultural realities to shape individual’s physical and mental health. We will also discuss how social conditions, particularly during key developmental stages, can have lifelong consequences for individual’s health and well-being.|Anna Mueller|Rosenwald Hall 329|Inequality, Health and the Life Course|1|[43214]|[]|SEM

The category has become increasingly differentiated over time, and academic discourse has shifted its focus from difference to integration in the form of “globalization.” If, today, it would appear naïve to use the term indiscriminately, it would be equally naïve to dispense with it altogether. We continue to make the distinction between “first” and “third” worlds (although using different, euphemistic terms) because it marks real differences between domains. In this course, we take up the difference in urban structures and processes. We will consider the “Third World city” a meaningful analytical category—to be distinguished, on the one hand, from the “First World” cities that inform so much of urban sociology, and, on the other, from global cities. We will spend the course discussing how and why these cities are different. In particular, we will talk about their explosive growth in the twentieth century, the precarious nature of urban employment, informal settlement as a major urban form, the housing divide as a social structure distinct to such cities, class formation, the impact of neoliberal reforms, democratization, urban spatial restructuring in the 1990s, and urban politics.

What social variables influence and shape 'real' markets and market activities? 'If you are so smart, why aren't you rich?' is a question economists have been asked in the past. Why isn't it easy to make money in financial areas even if one knows what economists know about markets, finance and the economy? And why, on the hand, is it so easy to get rich for some participants? Perhaps the answer is the real markets are complex social and cultural institutions which are quite different form organizations, administrations and the production side of the economy. The course provides an overview over social and cultural variables and patterns that play a role in economic behavior and specifically in financial markets. The readings examine the historical and structural embeddedness of economic action and institutions, the different constructions and interpretations of money, prices, and other dimensions of a market economy, and how a financial economy affects organizations, the art and other areas.|Karin Knorr Cetina|Haskell Hall 315|Maverick Markets:  Cultural Economy and Cultural Finance|1|[54364]|[]|SEM

The main objective of the course is to gain insight into the scope of spatial regression methods, to be able to apply them in an empirical setting, and to properly interpret the results of spatial regression analysis. While the focus is on spatial aspects, the types of methods covered have general validity in statistical practice. The course covers the specification of spatial regression models in order to incorporate spatial dependence and spatial heterogeneity, as well as different estimation methods and specification tests to detect the presence of spatial autocorrelation and spatial heterogeneity. Special attention is paid to the application to spatial models of generic statistical paradigms, such as Maximum Likelihood, Generalized Methods of Moments and the Bayesian perspective.

SOCI402261[43236]|Graduate|Open|SOCI40226|Mon Wed : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM|This research seminar is designed for graduate students who are eager to investigate how the Great Recession in the past decade has affected the life course trajectories of people, especially children and youth, in various demographic groups defined by the intersections of social class, race/ethnicity, gender, and urbanisity. Dramatic changes in the economic context have posed challenges to individuals, families, and communities to various degrees, which offer opportunities to revisit and possibly revise theories about human development. The class will raise big questions substantiated by the literature and will ask specific questions for empirical investigation. These questions will then evolve into research projects to be carried out collectively or individually through analyzing large-scale longitudinal data sets. The process will involve discussions of appropriate research designs, development of data analytic plans, and interpretations of empirical evidence. Throughout the course, students will receive hands-on training on how to write an empirical paper for an academic journal. Students are expected to produce single-authored or co-authored manuscripts at the end of the course. Pre-requisites for this course are at least one and preferably two applied statistics courses.|Guanglei Hong|TBA|Youth of the Great Recession|1|[43236]|[]|SEM

The clearest expression of its urges, of its battles, and, as Adorno would say, of its own contradictions. Catalunya is one of the most modern and European-like countries of the west. This desire for modernism is expressed in artists such as Salvador Dalí as well as the avant-garde daydreaming theater of La Fura dels Baus. In Catalunya, a small country, theater was the national defense during Franco’s dictatorship and in the present times serves as a nationalist weapon to claim independence. In this course, we will explore the history of Catalunya and Europe through theater, by means of written literature and footage of performances which will make lectures more dynamic and attractive. Also, we will meet the personal dramas of women and their social and historical implications through the theory of gender. Theater is a recreational and collective way of understanding a culture, thus it will be proposed to the students the possibility of creating a short play written and performed by them. Methodologically, the course is multifaceted and intertextual. The analysis tools are comparatist, historical, political, linguistic, psychiatric, and philosophical; the approach is creative (writing and acting) and related to cultural studies and feminism.

Psychotherapy for persons presenting with chronic distress present a unique set of challenges. Most research in psychotherapy outcomes suggest that one of the most important factors associated with successful treatment is the relationship between the client and therapist. Traditionally, focus on the therapeutic relationship has been the purview of experiential and psychodynamic therapies. However, in the past ten years, three behavioral models of psychotherapy have been introduced that focus on the relationship in the therapy session. To varying degrees, these therapies are based on a large body of knowledge developed over the past several decades in the study of verbal behavior. In this class, participants will be introduced to a behavioral conceptualization of phenomena such as emotion, memory, cognition, and beliefs. Discussion of these private behaviors will conclude in a presentation of a behavioral theory of the “sense of self”. For the remainder of the course, participants will revisit these concepts as they apply to discussion of three influential behavioral therapies. First, participants will become acquainted with specific clinician behaviors that foster the curative role of the therapist as articulated in Functional Analytic Psychotherapy (FAP) developed by Robert Kohlenberg. Second, participants will discuss the role of verbal behavior in human suffering and the “recontextualization” of painful private experience presented in Acceptance and Commitment Therapy developed by Steven Hayes. Finally, participants will be introduced to the therapeutic dialectic of acceptance and change as outlined in Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) developed by Marsha Linehan. The goal of the course will be to briefly introduce participants to FAP and ACT and to provide an overview of the principles and strategies of DBT that explicitly address the diffuse, troubling experiences presented by most chronically distressed individuals.|Jancey Wickstrom|TBA|Fundamentals of Behavioral Therapy:  Contemporary Approaches|2|[42614]|[]|LEC

The clinician practicing MI helps those with whom they are working acknowledge and explore ambivalence in regards to behavior change. Furthermore, once a client decides to make (or not make) changes, the MI clinician collaborates in determining a course of action. MI, though simple at first glance, is complex and requires ongoing training and practice.

The clinician practicing MI helps those with whom they are working acknowledge and explore ambivalence in regards to behavior change. Furthermore, once a client decides to make (or not make) changes, the MI clinician collaborates in determining a course of action. MI, though simple at first glance, is complex and requires ongoing training and practice. This course is designed to provide students with an in-depth understanding of MI and how to practice it within various treatment settings.

Although many of these clients carry a significant psychological burden derived from the internalization of oppressive experience, clinical response is frequently limited to concrete services and problem-solving tasks. Successful engagement of socially vulnerable clients in therapeutic intervention requires an integrated approach that addresses individual dynamic issues and environmental concerns simultaneously.

It is a comprehensive treatment regimen focusing on the transformation of behavior responses to intrapersonal, interpersonal and environmental factors contributing to problems related to impulsivity, emotional lability, cognitive dysregulation and interpersonal chaos. Due to its success treating various psychiatric populations, DBT is now considered effective with persons who engage in any behavior where the function of the behavior is to avoid or escape aversive thoughts and/or emotions. DBT was one of the first cognitive behavior therapies to integrate mindfulness, acceptance and willingness into treatment regimens that traditionally focus on change and control. It is therefore considered a pioneering therapy in what is now called the ""third wave"" in behaviorism. This class is intended to provide students with advanced training in the principles and practice of DBT. To that end, via lecture, experiential exercises, roleplay and a self-change project, participants will be exposed to the four components of DBT: Skills Training, Individual Therapy, Telephone Consultation and the Consultation Group. However, a basic tenet of DBT is that therapists should not expect their clients to engage in behaviors and activities they are unwilling to do. Therefore, emphasis in this class will be place on experiential knowledge. Therefore, interested participants will be expected to make a basic set of commitments that expose them to many of the emotional reactions experienced by their future clients. In addition to a self-change project, participants will commit to complete a diary card and practice mindfulness on a daily basis. Other learning activities include co-facilitating and participating in a skills group, a DBT individual therapy session and a consultation group."|E Paul Holmes|TBA|Psychthrpy: Chron Distr Pers|3|[42661]|[]|LEC

SSAD563001[42725]|Graduate|Open|SSAD56300|Thu : 09:00 AM-11:50 AM|This qualitative research seminar is designed to support the productivity and promote the development of advanced doctoral students who have chosen a qualitative research design as part of the dissertation. This applied seminar creates a structured and rigorous context for students to learn with instructor guidance and experience all stages of the interpretive research process through designing, executing, evaluating, and presenting their own interpretive research. It is an expectation of this seminar that all students make substantial and ongoing contributions to the group learning process through providing peer feedback, group coding, group analysis, constructing/critiquing conceptual models and theoretical frameworks, and learning how to critically evaluate and enhance the methodological rigor in the projects of those involved in the seminar. It is designed to be a dynamic environment for moving forward with one's work at all stages of the dissertation process; group needs and the instructor's assessment of student's individual progress will drive the content of each meeting. Prerequisites: A qualitative research course through SSA or approved equivalent. Students must have passed their qualifying examinations, selected a research topic, and be actively constructing their dissertation proposals. Permission of the instructor is required and enrollment is limited to maximize student learning in the structure of a seminar.|Gina E Samuels|TBA|Applied Qualt Research Sem|1|[42725]|[]|SEM
SSAD568011[42726]|Graduate|Open|SSAD56801|Thu : 12:00 PM-01:20 PM|This workshop will provide SSA doctoral students with the opportunity to examine the diverse social science theories that undergird social work and social welfare— as defined by contemporary scholarship in the field. The workshop is organized to support this process by offering bimonthly presentations loosely determined by a set of questions basic to the development of any field of inquiry: What fundamental epistemological paradigms are represented? What theoretical and conceptual frameworks undergird scholarship in social work and social welfare? How do scholars in the field ask questions and find answers? How do they make claims and support them? What specific research methods are used? The workshop is designed to introduce beginning students to ongoing research and scholarship in the School and to provide advanced students and faculty with a regular forum for presentation and discussion of their work. Participation in this seminar is required for first-year students; advanced doctoral students and faculty are encouraged to attend on a regular basis. One faculty member or advanced doctoral student will present his or her research each session and may assign readings in advance.|Sydney L Hans|TBA|Wkshp:Theories In Soc Wk Res 1|1|[42726]|[]|SEM

This course offers a systematic way to construct and evaluate questionnaires. We will learn to think about survey questions from the perspective of the respondent and in terms of cognitive and social tasks that underlie responding. We will examine the impact of questions on data quality and will review past and recent methodological research on questionnaire development. The course will help students to tell the difference between better and worse types of survey questions, find and evaluate existing questions on different topics, and construct and test questionnaires for their own needs. Prerequisites: Graduate standing (no undergraduate standing). Students enrolled in this class are expected to have completed at least one course on research methods.

The course considers the spiritual and religious contexts shaping assessment and intervention processes in clinical social work services and examines the ways that faith traditions and spiritual experiences shape clients' and professionals' lives, and the points of connection they form with the delivery of clinical social work services. Rather than overviewing specific religious belief systems per se, this course will primarily be attuned to the ways that clients' faith traditions and spiritual experiences shape their healing and suffering. The course examines the resources as well as the dilemmas that clients' spiritual and religious traditions present in our attempts to provide effective clinical social work services, and the means by which spiritual and religious influences can be tapped by social workers to better their clients' lives. As a premise, this class takes the view that spirituality and faith traditions are experienced in a diversity of ways, and thus issues of difference and sensitivity to different expressions and experiences of spirituality and religious practice form a bedrock of considering clinical services to clients.|Stanley McCracken|TBA|Spirituality & Social Work Practice|1|[42728]|[]|LEC

SSAD612001[42754]|Graduate|Open|SSAD61200|Wed : 09:00 AM-11:50 AM|As the largest generation in American history ages, there is an urgent need for social workers trained in the special issues affecting older adults. This course will examine the forces which shape the evolution of both the perception and experience of aging in the 21st century. The course will consider the aging process from a variety of perspectives: physiological, sociocultural, and phenomenological. We will draw on multiple disciplines, including the arts, to present the diversity of the aging experience and to explore the manifold ways in which the dynamic interaction between the older person and his or her social and physical environment affects quality of life. Finally, the course will address expanding opportunities for social workers in direct service, administration, and policy-making in service of America's older population.|Stacey Gordon|TBA|Intro to Aging:  21st Century Perspectives|1|[42754]|[]|LEC

We will be particularly concerned with how educational policy has been shaped and with the problematics of translating policy into practice. The second strand is theoretical; we will be trying to understand these very contemporary problems through the lens of classical theory; that is, functionalism, Max Weber's theory of bureaucracy and Marx's theory of class conflict.|Charles M.

SSAD637001[42763]|Graduate|Closed|SSAD63700|Thu : 05:30 PM-06:30 PM|ACT is an example of what is commonly referred to as a third wave behavioral therapy. It is unique in its development in that it was derived from some of the implications of basic research on the function of verbal behavior. This approach suggests that psychological distress is the result of how humans relate to their psychological experience rather than the result of a mental or even biological pathology. ACT assists clients in differentiating between those aspects of life where the only viable stance is that of acceptance and willingness and those where action is required given their desire to live meaningfully. In doing so, clients fundamentally shift from having their lives about their past and their problems to a life about their values and their future. This class is intended to provide students with a comprehensive overview of and practice with the principles of ACT. To that end, via lecture, experiential exercises, role-play and a self-change project, participants will be presented with the underlying theory (Relation Frame Theory) and assumptions of ACT, an ACT conceptualization of human suffering, a model of psychological rigidity and flexibility and the six basic clinical processes. ACT emphasizes experiential knowledge over intellectual ascent. To that end, participants should anticipate numerous individual and group activities and exercises aimed at providing first-person experience with the processes and outcomes associated with the practice of living.|E Paul Holmes|TBA|Acceptance and Commitment Therapy|1|[42763]|[]|LEC

The theoretical discussions and the dramaturgical exercises will focus on the following issues and the connections between them: 1. The agon and the encounter 2. Violence and the ludic logic of tragedy 3. Entrances, exits and supernatural interventions 4. Models 'for' and models 'of' theatrical and performative practices 5. Dramaturgies of thinking and doing As a common backdrop to these issues the seminar will explore the possibilities to outline a coherent basis for a theatrical and performative dispositive, laying the basis for what Brecht in 1929 envisioned as a philosophical future for the theatre.

TAPS283101[42565]|Undergraduate|Open|TAPS28310|Tue Thu : 10:30 AM-11:50 AM|This course will focus on cinematographic representations of theatrical and other artistic practices, primarily exemplified by many of Ingmar Bergman's films (e.g. The Seventh Seal and Fanny and Alexander) but also in the work of other film-directors. It will explore historical and theoretical issues related to the mutual interactions between cinema and theatre also discussing cinematographic techniques in playwriting as exemplified in plays by Henrik Ibsen (e.g. Peer Gynt) and August Strindberg (e.g. A Dream Play and The Ghost Sonata). Throughout most of his creative career Bergman worked both in theatre and film and even if he is mostly known outside of Sweden as a film director, his theatrical career was as innovative. The work of the film-auteur and the theatre director are for Bergman closely connected, not only through the actors he worked with – during summers for the screen and during the theatre seasons in stage productions – but also through the choice of themes, which are often in direct dialogue with each other in the two media, generating complex meta-aesthetic, inter-medial discourses, depicting and problematizing the work and role of the artist in a broad range of social and ideological contexts.

We will read plays and performances closely, taking into account form, character, plot, and genre, but also staging, acting, spectatorship, and historical conventions. In the process we will ask how various agents—playwrights, directors, performers, and audiences—generate plays and give them meaning, and students will become agents themselves by devising and performing scenes as a parallel mode of interpretation.

While the genre is one often denigrated as staging lyrical utopias of Romance and adventure allowing audiences to escape depressing quotidian realities, many musicals did seek to engage some of the most pressing social issues of their day. In this course, we will look—and listen—closely to four differing musicals from the 20th century, studying their creative origins, while also analyzing their complex social meanings revealed through the story, music, lyrics, staging, and dance.

THEO406001[41256]|Graduate|Open|THEO40600|Wed : 12:00 PM-02:50 PM|Contemporary black theology, with its beginnings on July 31, 1966, was created by African American clergy who offered one interpretation of the new black consciousness movement of the 1960s. Already, we can see that, perhaps, black theology might be the only theological discipline in the USA that did not originate in the academy. Instead, it was birthed out of people’s everyday lives searching for human dignity and a better community on earth. The course examines the 2nd generation of black theologians, starting with 1979. As the new body of knowledge progressed, thinkers saw the necessity to clarify its conceptual, theoretical, and theological positions. An entire body of literature, over half a century of writing, has arisen defining the methodological contours of this USA creation. This course explores the responses and critiques internal to black theology. Specifically, with a firm foundation set by the 1st generation of black religious scholars (1960s), we will now review the 2nd generation (1979 onward). How did this discipline seek to correct itself with debate among the 2nd generation of black theologians?|Dwight Hopkins|Swift Hall 403|Black Theology: Second Generation|1|[41256]|[]|SEM

This course engages a newer generation of womanist theologies. The 1979 founding and first generation of womanist scholars, especially Jacquelyn Grant, Delores Williams, and Katie Cannon, presented foundational scholarly issues, methods, and epistemologies just to begin a new academic (and life) discipline. This course will look at recent womanist scholars who build on the first generation but carry the discipline of womanist theology into some new and, at times, quite challenging directions that call into question some of the cornerstone tenets of the discipline.|Dwight Hopkins|Swift Hall 403|Womanist Theology: A New Generation|1|[41258]|[]|SEM

This course will focus on a number of medieval women writers, dealing mainly albeit not exclusively with vernacular texts. After a historical overview of the position of women in the early Middle Ages, the course will focus on Heloise and Hildegard of Bingen as transitional figures, and continue with four women writers writing in the vernacular, i.e., Mechtild of Magdeburg, Hadewijch, Marguerite Porete and Julian of Norwich. The course will link the spectrum of vernacular languages which they represent to the diversity of their individual positions and analyze that diversity in terms of ecclesiastical developments, gender division, authorial identity, and theological criticism. The final aim is to come to an assessment of the constructive contribution of these vernacular treatises to the tradition of late medieval theology and spirituality|Willemien Otten|Swift Hall 208|Late Medieval Women: Authorship and Authority|1|[41260]|[]|LEC

The residency/student teaching is comprised of a year-long experience consisting of two half-year placements (residents are in schools four days/week from September through January, and then again in a different school placement from January through June) in two urban schools—where they progressively assume all teaching responsibilities. The half day Residency Seminar that accompanies student teaching ensures integration between academic coursework and the residency, and provides ongoing professional development in pedagogy. Candidates concentrate on four domains of professional practice: planning, preparation, and assessment; instructional delivery; classroom environment and learning community; and professional responsibilities. They reflect on their classroom practice through video analysis, review of student work, lesson study, journal sharing, and group debriefing. They also continue their work in working with second-language learners special-needs students. Finally, the residency and seminar will integrate fine arts and health related activities into work with children as well as with the cohort.|Jeanette Bartley, Sheri Roedel|Chap 250|Residency and Seminary III|1|[42318]|[]|SEM
