While in an age of global migrations, multilingual speakers have come to outnumber the number of monolingual speakers, literary studies continue to privilege works aimed at a monolingual audience. This is particularly the case in the United States, where “English-only” attitudes have dominated discourse for over a century. This course instead explores literary works that take up residence in the space between two or more languages, whether national or regional—as well as those that attempt to dodge semantic systems altogether. From modernist collage and transense to contemporary poetry of exile, migration, and diaspora, the works we will study, lodged between tongues, lend nuance and fascination to debates surrounding “global literature” and untranslatability. We will examine the formal and social prompts and repercussions of experiments in polylingualism, barbarism, dialect, creole, and thwarted translation, and will delve into examples of the potential for mixed/new media poetics to accommodate multiple linguistic systems.

With a view to probing an inter- and intra-relationship between censorship practices among a variety of imperial/colonial regions, this course studies the institutions related to censorship, the human agents involved in censorship—both external and internal—and texts and translations that were produced in and outside of Korea, and were subject to censorship.

As a result, the city itself has come to occupy a mythic position as a central hub of Western intellectual culture: uprooted from its geographical specificity by the circulation of such proper names as Machiavelli, Leonardo, Michelangelo, and unmoored from its historical heritage by the disorienting complexities of modern mass tourism.

Rather, scholars today recognize that colonial encounters were complex culture, political, and economic fields of interaction. Africans actively adopted, reworked, and contested colonizers' policies and projects, and Europeans drew heavily from these encounters to form liberal conceptions of self, nation, and society.

This course will examine this three-hundred-year history by investigating the following essential questions: (1) How did a collection of diverse kingdoms manage to create a global empire? (2) What specific factors can explain the Spanish decline of the seventeenth century? (3) Was the Spanish Empire doomed to fail from the very beginning? (4) Why did many colonial subjects remain loyal to Spain after the Conquest and especially after a century of decline? (5) Why did the empire collapse only after 1808? In our exploration of these questions, we will pay particular attention to Spain's ambitious and pioneering, if also destructive, involvement with conquest, colonial exploitation, chattel slavery, racial domination, and a mission to \"civilize\" the world. We will then proceed to investigate the Spanish decline of the seventeenth century and the influence of the emerging empires of Britain, France, and the Dutch Republic.

But what is wisdom? It’s often used with a meaning more akin to \"smart\" or \"clever.\" Is it just vast knowledge? This course will examine the nature of wisdom—how it has been defined, how its meaning has changed, and what its essential components might be. We will examine how current psychological theories conceptualize wisdom and consider whether, and how, wisdom can be studied scientifically; that is, can wisdom be measured and experimentally manipulated to illuminate its underlying mechanisms and understand its functions?

Since the late 1990s, a reassessment of the legacy of the NLAC has been taking shape as scholars have begun to interrogate its canonical status in the face of a changed political climate. In the sphere of filmmaking, contemporary Latin American new wave cinemas are also grappling with that legacy-sometimes disavowing it, sometimes appropriating it.

In this course we try to understand these emotional attachments by examining the narrative of loss and redemption through which most nations in the Balkans retell their Ottoman past. We begin by considering the mythic temporality of the Romantic national narrative while focusing on specific national literary texts where the national past is retold through the formula of original wholeness, foreign invasion, Passion, and Salvation. We then proceed to unpack the structural role of the different elements of that narrative. With the help of Žižek’s theory of the subject as constituted by trauma, we think about the national fixation on the trauma of loss, and the role of trauma in the formation of national consciousness. Specific theme inquiries involve the figure of the Janissary as self and other, brotherhood and fratricide, and the writing of the national trauma on the individual physical body. Special attention is given to the general aesthetic of victimhood, the casting of the victimized national self as the object of the “other’s perverse desire.” With the help of Freud, Žižek, and Kant we consider the transformation of national victimhood into the sublimity of the national self.

While many of the concepts explored here will be recognizable as part of the “bread and butter” of anthropological research, the course is less interested in providing a comprehensive survey of 20th century anthropology than in interrogating the discipline’s signature style of theory building through ethnographic engagements in “the field.” We start from the premise that anthropological theory is a dialectical practice through which realist arguments about the historical world(s)—and the human’s place in it—are honed through empirical encounters and pushback from anthropology’s ethnographic subjects.

This course will examine this three-hundred-year history by investigating the following essential questions: (1) How did a collection of diverse kingdoms manage to create a global empire? (2) What specific factors can explain the Spanish decline of the seventeenth century? (3) Was the Spanish Empire doomed to fail from the very beginning? (4) Why did many colonial subjects remain loyal to Spain after the Conquest and especially after a century of decline? (5) Why did the empire collapse only after 1808? In our exploration of these questions, we will pay particular attention to Spain's ambitious and pioneering, if also destructive, involvement with conquest, colonial exploitation, chattel slavery, racial domination, and a mission to \"civilize\" the world. We will then proceed to investigate the Spanish decline of the seventeenth century and the influence of the emerging empires of Britain, France, and the Dutch Republic.

Reading Paine’s Common Sense and the letters of Abigail Adams and John Adams we look at the multiple meanings of independence. We study Jefferson’s drafting process, read the Declaration over the shoulders of people on both sides of the Atlantic, and consider clues to contemporary meanings beyond the intentions of Congress. Finally, we briefly engage the post-revolutionary history of the place and meaning of the Declaration in American life.

This, in many ways, reflects the narrative eighteenth-century writers were developing about their own age. For British Whigs, the “Glorious Revolution” of 1688 had been a watershed moment at which the arbitrary rule of kings had been replaced for all time by constitutionalism; the social contract and the civil polity had triumphed over divine-right ideology, ushering in a new, beneficent era of progress. And, in the 1790s, the French Revolution fired the political imaginations of British radicals who saw the potential for a world made anew – a world of universal suffrage and gender equality, where slavery was abolished. Clearly, attaining these goals was a long way off. The debates over the structures, meanings, and nature of consent had tendrils in multiple areas of society – the law, of course, but also in understandings of sexuality, constructions of gender, economics, and colonization. Questions of rights, agency, and authority (what those categories meant, who could possess them, and who guaranteed them) were by no means settled, and, indeed, throughout the century, calls to curtail the categories of people who should have access to the sphere of political influence were often as boisterous as those to expand such access. This course will explore how a range of authors in eighteenth-century Britain figured questions of consent, rights, and authority and how the ideological debates these authors mediated continue to inform contemporary politics, cultures, and identities. We will read works by literary figures such as Daniel Defoe, Samuel Richardson, Mary Hays, Olaudah Equiano, and Mary Shelley. We will consider the writings of some of the major political philosophers of the day, as well, including John Locke, Thomas Hobbes, Mary Astell, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Thomas Paine, and Mary Wollstonecraft.

Rather, scholars today recognize that colonial encounters were complex culture, political, and economic fields of interaction. Africans actively adopted, reworked, and contested colonizers' policies and projects, and Europeans drew heavily from these encounters to form liberal conceptions of self, nation, and society. Over the course of the quarter, students will learn about forms of personhood, political economy, and everyday life in the twentieth century.

Our guiding inquiries will be simultaneously interpretive, theoretical, and historical: What does it mean to think of form as an “exteriorization” of one’s “will”? Whose will do these forms represent (who is the “us” in Rivera’s “our will”)? What representational strategies enable this exteriorization and dramatize its limitations? Why was the novel so often singled out, and why did some feminist writers prefer instead a collection of letters, poems, journal entries, and personal essays?

We will apply the concepts and techniques of corporate finance to actual situations. The course is roughly divided into three sections: (1) financing decisions; (2) investment decisions; (3) entrepreneurial finance; and (4) private equity finance. In addition to analyzing the specific financing problems or issues, we will consider how those issues relate to the strategic objectives of the firm. It will be important to examine the \"big picture\" assumptions that are used in the numerical calculations. This course also places a strong emphasis on presentation and discussion skills. It will be important to explain your positions or arguments to each other and to try to argue for the implementation of your recommendations. COURSE PROCEDURES For each class meeting, I will assign study questions concerning one or two case studies. For most of the class period, we will consider the questions and the material in the cases. This includes the first meeting. You are allowed and encouraged, but not required to meet in groups outside of class to discuss and analyze the cases. Each group will submit a two-page memorandum of analysis and recommendations at the beginning of each case discussion. If you are working in a group, I will accept one memorandum from the group and count it for all students in the group. If you choose to do this, the group can include up to 3 students. Each memorandum should be typed and double-spaced. Write these as if you were writing a recommendation to the CEO or major decision maker in the case. The two page limit is for text only. You may attach as many numerical calculations as you wish. Memoranda will not be accepted after the class has met. A memorandum will be given credit if it is handed in and no credit if it is not. Initially, therefore, I will not grade them. However, I will use the memoranda to determine final grades for those students who are on the border of two grades. You should prepare a memorandum for UST, the first class. The readings and articles that I have assigned and will hand out are largely non-technical in nature and summarize the findings of academic research in corporate finance in the recent past. These articles are meant to be background material that will help you analyze the cases. They should not necessarily be cited in the case discussion. You should argue as if you were in a corporate boardroom rather than in a doctoral seminar. The process of arriving at the answer is as important as getting the answer. Because of the nature of this course (and its grading criteria), it is extremely important that you attend every class, arrive on time and be prepared to participate. To help me out, you should bring your name cards to each class. I may not remember who said what without those cards. In the past, students have asked me to hand out my case analysis after the class has discussed the case. I will not do this, because there are usually no absolute right answers. The best cases are deliberately written to be ambiguous. While there are no right answers, there are good arguments and bad arguments. This course is designed to help you learn to distinguish between sensible and senseless arguments. Handing out my analyses would reduce the ambiguity in the cases and partially defeat the purpose of doing cases. If you are uncomfortable with ambiguity, this class may not be for you.

This, in many ways, reflects the narrative eighteenth-century writers were developing about their own age. For British Whigs, the “Glorious Revolution” of 1688 had been a watershed moment at which the arbitrary rule of kings had been replaced for all time by constitutionalism; the social contract and the civil polity had triumphed over divine-right ideology, ushering in a new, beneficent era of progress. And, in the 1790s, the French Revolution fired the political imaginations of British radicals who saw the potential for a world made anew – a world of universal suffrage and gender equality, where slavery was abolished. Clearly, attaining these goals was a long way off. The debates over the structures, meanings, and nature of consent had tendrils in multiple areas of society – the law, of course, but also in understandings of sexuality, constructions of gender, economics, and colonization. Questions of rights, agency, and authority (what those categories meant, who could possess them, and who guaranteed them) were by no means settled, and, indeed, throughout the century, calls to curtail the categories of people who should have access to the sphere of political influence were often as boisterous as those to expand such access. This course will explore how a range of authors in eighteenth-century Britain figured questions of consent, rights, and authority and how the ideological debates these authors mediated continue to inform contemporary politics, cultures, and identities. We will read works by literary figures such as Daniel Defoe, Samuel Richardson, Mary Hays, Olaudah Equiano, and Mary Shelley. We will consider the writings of some of the major political philosophers of the day, as well, including John Locke, Thomas Hobbes, Mary Astell, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Thomas Paine, and Mary Wollstonecraft.

Yet we often fail to see the extent to which the questions which we ask of all of these diverse sources are conditioned by Christian rhetoric about pagan worship. In this course, we compare two moments when Christians encountered \"pagans\": during the initial Christian construction of a discourse on paganism (and, more broadly, a discourse on religion) during the late Roman empire and during the Spanish discovery of the New World. Our course examines silences and absences in the textual and material records, as well as the divergences between texts and objects, in order to further our understanding of ancient religious practice.

For a final project, students will plan and produce footage for an individual or small group short film. The first half the class will be highly structured, with demonstrations, in-class shoots and lectures. As the semester continues, class time will open up to more of a workshop format to address the specific concerns and issues that arise in the production of the final projects.

In this course, we will explore the history of Catalunya and Europe through theater, by means of written literature and footage of performances which will make lectures more dynamic and attractive. Also, we will meet the personal dramas of women and their social and historical implications through the theory of gender. Theater is a recreational and collective way of understanding a culture, thus it will be proposed to the students the possibility of creating a short play written and performed by them. Methodologically, the course is multifaceted and intertextual.

We then proceed to unpack the structural role of the different elements of that narrative. With the help of Žižek’s theory of the subject as constituted by trauma, we think about the national fixation on the trauma of loss, and the role of trauma in the formation of national consciousness. Specific theme inquiries involve the figure of the Janissary as self and other, brotherhood and fratricide, and the writing of the national trauma on the individual physical body. Special attention is given to the general aesthetic of victimhood, the casting of the victimized national self as the object of the “other’s perverse desire.” With the help of Freud, Žižek, and Kant we consider the transformation of national victimhood into the sublimity of the national self.

We will consider what it means to have a body, to know a body, to be defined by a body – in short, to live a body. This class’s topical readings are oriented around the idea that “embodiment” involves both material entities and socially embedded processes. We will consider experience, consciousness, sensation, perception, and affect; we will interrogate processes, functions, and ways of knowing that are often taken for granted; we will prise apart the ways power is inscribed on and with bodies, both internally and externally.

From this perspective, slavery can only be a relation of domination or as a vanishing moment before the enslaved contracts into servitude. In the process of installing this perspective, philosophical modernity foreclosed myriad philosophical and legal traditions of self-enslavement at the precise moment that slavery itself was generalized as the Atlantic world’s foundational mode of political and social relation.

Its ambiguities and political antinomies allow for interdisciplinary readings that also present an opportunity to critically overview the established approaches to main Conradian themes.

This, in many ways, reflects the narrative eighteenth-century writers were developing about their own age. For British Whigs, the “Glorious Revolution” of 1688 had been a watershed moment at which the arbitrary rule of kings had been replaced for all time by constitutionalism; the social contract and the civil polity had triumphed over divine-right ideology, ushering in a new, beneficent era of progress. And, in the 1790s, the French Revolution fired the political imaginations of British radicals who saw the potential for a world made anew – a world of universal suffrage and gender equality, where slavery was abolished. Clearly, attaining these goals was a long way off. The debates over the structures, meanings, and nature of consent had tendrils in multiple areas of society – the law, of course, but also in understandings of sexuality, constructions of gender, economics, and colonization. Questions of rights, agency, and authority (what those categories meant, who could possess them, and who guaranteed them) were by no means settled, and, indeed, throughout the century, calls to curtail the categories of people who should have access to the sphere of political influence were often as boisterous as those to expand such access. This course will explore how a range of authors in eighteenth-century Britain figured questions of consent, rights, and authority and how the ideological debates these authors mediated continue to inform contemporary politics, cultures, and identities. We will read works by literary figures such as Daniel Defoe, Samuel Richardson, Mary Hays, Olaudah Equiano, and Mary Shelley. We will consider the writings of some of the major political philosophers of the day, as well, including John Locke, Thomas Hobbes, Mary Astell, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Thomas Paine, and Mary Wollstonecraft.

The course should be as valuable to the general business lawyer and the legally trained private equity investor or investment banker as it is to the litigator. There is no assumption of advanced skill or training in economics and no complex mathematical or economic tools are required. Antitrust has been defined not by rulemaking and statutory expansion, but by judges deciding cases, one at a time, in the common law tradition, in large part because the antitrust statutes are very terse and compact (unlike statues in other business fields such as securities regulation, banking regulation and the regulation of telecommunications). Most antitrust issues have been back and forth to the Supreme Court repeatedly. This allows students to see how succeeding generations of great judges have wrestled with the core issues in the field. For these reasons, the great beauty of antitrust is to see it as, essentially, a common law subject, evolving and adapting over its 120-year history.

The course takes a genealogical approach to “anthropological theory” by tracking the formation, uptake and entailments of different problem-spaces in anthropology—that is, the distinct complex of questions-and-answers around key themes and problems, which animate the discipline’s various modes of knowledge production. The course takes seriously the interplay of ethnographic inquiry and theory building and of professional practice and public engagement in the development of anthropology as a modern (and postmodern) discipline. While many of the concepts explored here will be recognizable as part of the “bread and butter” of anthropological research, the course is less interested in providing a comprehensive survey of 20th century anthropology than in interrogating the discipline’s signature style of theory building through ethnographic engagements in “the field.” We start from the premise that anthropological theory is a dialectical practice through which realist arguments about the historical world(s)—and the human’s place in it—are honed through empirical encounters and pushback from anthropology’s ethnographic subjects. Ultimately, the course hopes to track how anthropological ways of knowing intervene in the world through the making and stabilizing of particular lived concepts; that is, we ask after theory’s historical formation and durable effects, its social life, as well as afterlives, in the discipline and beyond.", "instructor": "Julie Chu", "sectionid": "[43429]", "section": "1", "career": "Graduate", "type": "SEM"}, "CHEM43000": {"daytime": "TBA", "name": "Research:  Inorganic Chemistry", "subsections": [], "location": "TBA", "condition": "Open", "description": "Readings and Research for working on their PhD", "instructor": "Dmitri Talapin", "sectionid": "[40998]", "section": "1", "career": "Graduate", "type": "RSC"}, "CRWR33017": {"daytime": "Thu : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM", "name": "Special Topics in Poetry: Image, Perception, Sense", "subsections": [], "location": "TBA", "condition": "Open", "description": "In this special topics course we will investigate and experiment with various approaches to imagery.

Does a poetic image necessarily entail a representational mode of thinking, or are their variations that resist literary mimesis?

Through the lens of live-client work, students examine how and where litigation fits into broader efforts to improve police accountability and ultimately the criminal justice system. Students provide legal services to indigent victims of police abuse in federal and state courts. They litigate civil rights cases at each level of the court system from trial through appeals. Some students also represent children and adults in related juvenile or criminal defense matters. Students take primary responsibility for all aspects of the litigation, including client counseling, fact investigation, case strategy, witness interviews, legal research, pleadings and legal memoranda, discovery, depositions, motion practice, evidentiary hearings, trials, and appeals. A significant amount of legal writing is expected. Students work in teams on cases or projects, and meet with the instructor on at minimum a weekly basis. Students also take primary responsibility for the Clinic’s policy and public education work. PAP teaches students to apply and critically examine legal theory in the context of representation of people in need. It teaches students to analyze how and why individual cases of abuse occur and to connect them to systemic problems, often leading to “public impact” litigation and other strategies for policy reform.

Literatures across the disciplines are full of living bodies and concrete experiences, object biographies, ‘theories of things,’ a return to ‘matter,’ ‘new’ materialisms spun out of ‘old’ ones… While generative, materiality’s ubiquity also betrays a gap, an ambiguity, an absence. For what materiality is exactly remains unsure. Some seem to use it as a descriptive shorthand for the material world. Others as an analytic tending to the materialness of existence. Or as a discourse on it. For others still, it denotes the tangible effects of actions, practice, signs, and thought. Or a framework for unpacking the relationships mediating between people and things… Conjurations abound, yet seldom escape a certain circularity (“materiality studies… materiality?”). The concept has been used to frame a near infinite horizon of topics, from artefacts, of course, to cosmology, faith, finance, and absence, encompassing phenomena both enduring and ephemeral, both there and not-there. In taking on so much, has materiality outlasted its usefulness? What analytic work did it perform in the first place?

Yet we often fail to see the extent to which the questions which we ask of all of these diverse sources are conditioned by Christian rhetoric about pagan worship. In this course, we compare two moments when Christians encountered \"pagans\": during the initial Christian construction of a discourse on paganism (and, more broadly, a discourse on religion) during the late Roman empire and during the Spanish discovery of the New World. Our course examines silences and absences in the textual and material records, as well as the divergences between texts and objects, in order to further our understanding of ancient religious practice.

Rather, scholars today recognize that colonial encounters were complex culture, political, and economic fields of interaction. Africans actively adopted, reworked, and contested colonizers' policies and projects, and Europeans drew heavily from these encounters to form liberal conceptions of self, nation, and society.

Alongside this, we consider the recent disciplinary revival of the categories of “global Anglophone” and “world literature” through readings on “literary worlds” to to evaluate these categories, and their contributions to ongoing debates about translation/translatability, vernaculars, rewriting, and mimicry.

In this course we try to understand these emotional attachments by examining the narrative of loss and redemption through which most nations in the Balkans retell their Ottoman past. We begin by considering the mythic temporality of the Romantic national narrative while focusing on specific national literary texts where the national past is retold through the formula of original wholeness, foreign invasion, Passion, and Salvation. We then proceed to unpack the structural role of the different elements of that narrative. With the help of Žižek’s theory of the subject as constituted by trauma, we think about the national fixation on the trauma of loss, and the role of trauma in the formation of national consciousness. Specific theme inquiries involve the figure of the Janissary as self and other, brotherhood and fratricide, and the writing of the national trauma on the individual physical body. Special attention is given to the general aesthetic of victimhood, the casting of the victimized national self as the object of the “other’s perverse desire.” With the help of Freud, Žižek, and Kant we consider the transformation of national victimhood into the sublimity of the national self.

As a matter of fact, scholars of Antiquity usually refer to Armenia only when it was involved into one of the frequent military crises between East and West. The country had an important strategic position, a vast expanse of territory, and wealthy natural resources. This explains very well the efforts of the Seleucids and of Rome, and of the Iranian dynasties of the Parthians and the Sassanids, to establish a military control and cultural influence over Armenia. Both contacts with the West and the East shaped the complex identity of Armenia - a somewhat mixed identity which is rather difficult to study. Therefore, both Classical and Iranian scholars tend to neglect the role of Armenia, or to diminish its position in the balance of power: the anachronistic cliché of a Greater Armenia as a «buffer state» is still mentioned. Accordingly, the few specialists on pre-Christian Armenia hardly communicate with those other scholars. Therefore, the very marginality of the kingdom of Armenia has not stimulated neither Classical scholars, nor Iranian scholars, to show interest in Armenia as well. This course will present a comprehensive history of ancient Armenia, from its origins to the fall of the kingdom in 428 CE, in order to reconstruct the history of the Artaxiad and of the Arsacid dynasties within a geopolitical frame considering the role of Armenia between Rome and Iran.”", "instructor": "Giusto Traina", "sectionid": "[43169]", "section": "1", "career": "Undergraduate", "type": "SEM"}, "CHEM42600": {"daytime": "TBA", "name": "Research: Physical Chemistry", "subsections": [], "location": "TBA", "condition": "Open", "description": "Readings and Research for working on their PhD", "instructor": "Karl F Freed", "sectionid": "[40995]", "section": "1", "career": "Graduate", "type": "RSC"}, "ANCC34400": {"daytime": "Mon Tue Thu Fri : 06:00 AM-05:00 PM", "name": "Anesthesia/Critical Care 4th Year ICU Elective", "subsections": [], "location": "Arranged ARR", "condition": "Open", "description": "", "instructor": "Michael Woo", "sectionid": "[40182]", "section": "43", "career": "Pritzker School of Medicine", "type": "CLK"}, "JWSC25200": {"daytime": "Tue Thu : 12:00 PM-01:20 PM", "name": "Introductory Modern Hebrew-3", "subsections": [], "location": "TBA", "condition": "Open", "description": "\"The beginner course aims to introduce students to the basic skills of reading, writing and pronunciation of Modern Hebrew.

The tools of engineering are important in making and translating basic discoveries in other fields into new intellectual opportunities and, sometimes, useful technologies. Institute for Molecular Engineering The Institute for Molecular Engineering (IME) is founded on the principle of collaborative problem-solving, not rigid academic disciplines. It is at the forefront of an emerging field that has the potential to address fundamental problems of societal import. This exciting new field involves the incorporation of synthetic molecular building blocks into functional systems that will impact technologies from advanced medical therapies to quantum computing. Created in partnership with Argonne National Laboratory, the IME builds on the tradition of collaboration and cutting-edge research well established at Argonne and the University of Chicago. It conducts research at the intersection of chemical, electrical, mechanical, and biological engineering, as well as materials, biological, and physical sciences. The institute’s exploration of innovative technologies in nanoscale manipulation and design at a molecular scale has the potential for impact in such areas as energy, health care, and the environment. Major Program in Molecular Engineering The BS degree program in Molecular Engineering offers undergraduates a cutting-edge engineering curriculum built on a strong foundation in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology. Courses are designed to develop quantitative reasoning and problem-solving skills; to introduce engineering analysis of physical, chemical, and biological systems; and to address open-ended technological questions across a spectrum of disciplines. The program will both prepare undergraduates for a wide variety of careers in technology-focused industries and position graduates for further postgraduate study in such fields as science, engineering, medicine, business, or law. The aim is to introduce invention and design, along with inquiry and discovery, as fruitful and complementary intellectual activities. Majors are able to choose from two quantitative engineering analysis tracks, one aimed at engineering with a biological, chemical, and soft materials emphasis, and one geared toward applied physics. The applied physics track, offered in close collaboration with the Department of Physics, is one of the first initiatives worldwide to formally educate quantum engineers at the undergraduate level. MENG 29500 Engineering Design is a 300-unit design course offered as a capstone, in which student teams spend an intensive quarter working with a faculty mentor to solve an open-ended problem, for example, analyzing chemical and biological properties of cancer cells to develop new treatment and delivery vehicles or harnessing the properties of electrons in materials to develop quantum information technologies. The course also combines technical skills with an exploration of economics, regulatory and legal issues, and ethics. Major Program Requirements 1. A strong and broad background in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology. It is imperative for a modern engineer to have a strong and broad background in the sciences. Traditional engineering disciplines have had requirements in math, chemistry, and physics for decades and many programs have evolved to require biology as well. The highly interdisciplinary nature of Molecular Engineering requires a foundation built across the mathematical, physical, and biological sciences. Students are encouraged to complete their general education requirements at the highest level for which they are prepared. This will position them better to take advantage of advanced electives and research opportunities. As discussed in more detail below, there will be two tracks for Molecular Engineering majors, one aimed towards engineering with a biological, chemical, and soft materials emphasis, and one aimed towards applied physics. Students in the former track will follow precedent set by Chemistry and Biological Sciences majors in that they will likely take chemistry in year 1, physics in year 2, and follow the recommended mathematics courses in the Chemistry curriculum. Students in the latter track will follow precedent set by Physics majors in that they will likely take physics in year 1, follow the mathematics guidelines of Physics majors, and take chemistry in year 2. 2. MENG 26030 Introduction to Engineering Analysis. One of the first courses for all Molecular Engineering majors, this course teaches students to apply mathematical methods towards solving problems that cut across multiple engineering sub-disciplines. A major objective of the course is to teach simple programming skills and computational methods in applied mathematics, including the use of engineering software such as Matlab, Mathematica, Comsol, and elements of Python. The skills that are introduced here will be further developed and strengthened throughout the rest of the curriculum. 3. Two quantitative engineering analysis tracks: Biological, Chemical, and Soft Materials Engineering and Quantum Engineering. Reflecting the research and education themes of the IME, two highly intertwined but recognizably different tracks for the major are available to students. One is aimed at preparing students oriented towards biological, chemical, and soft materials engineering, and the other is aimed at preparing students oriented towards engineering of quantum-based materials, devices, and processes. The latter track is offered in close collaboration with the Department of Physics. The main difference in the tracks relates to a choice between two sequences of three courses under the heading of quantitative engineering analysis. 4. MENG 29500 Engineering Design (300-unit capstone course). This “immersion” design course teaches students how to bring combinations of fundamental science and engineering together to solve open-ended and challenging engineering problems. It also serves as a vehicle to teach other equally important non-technical skills, including: • Problem identification: technology analysis, competitive analysis, market analysis, stakeholder analysis, product definition • Impact of the project, including sociological and engineering ethics • Project planning • Project economics: costs, value/investment analysis, risk analysis and adjustment • Prototyping, experimental design, data analysis, error analysis • IP: patenting, prior art, patentability • Legal and regulatory analysis • Proposing, presenting and reporting • Teamwork IME faculty and fellows will propose open-ended projects for which they will serve as mentors. Students will work together in groups of three. 5. Materials and advanced electives (3 required courses in the major). The major is offered in such a way as to allow for considerable flexibility for students to tailor their programs along individualized trajectories, with help from faculty advisors. Not only can students choose between two tracks, but they can further build breadth or depth through their choice of a materials course and advanced electives. Moreover, we anticipate that our students will use their general electives outside of the major requirements to strengthen their backgrounds in specific areas of interest, also in consultation with Molecular Engineering advisors, to achieve desired outcomes such as preparation for graduate school in more traditional engineering disciplines. 6. Laboratory skills and hands-on experience. Critical skills that molecular engineers must acquire as part of their educational program include the ability to apply knowledge of mathematics, science, and engineering and the ability to design and conduct experiments, as well as the ability to analyze and interpret data. Molecular Engineering majors develop these skills through lab components associated with required courses in the physical and biological sciences, Molecular Engineering courses including MENG 26101-26102 Transport Phenomena I: Forces + Flows; Transport Phenomena II, MENG 26201-26202 Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics I-II, MENG 29500 Engineering Design, and some of the advanced electives such as MENG 27300 Polymer Physics and Engineering. We also anticipate that many Molecular Engineering students will receive advanced laboratory experience pursuing undergraduate research projects. 7. Non-technical skills. Many decades of workshops and panels engaging stakeholders in academia and industry, often associated with the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET), have identified criteria for outcomes of students in accredited engineering education programs. Although there is no thought of seeking ABET accreditation for the Molecular Engineering major, many ABET criteria, particularly those related to non-technological skills, are viewed as essential to incorporate into the Molecular Engineering major. Examples of student outcomes that fall into this category include: (a) an ability to formulate or design a system, process, or program to meet desired needs, (b) an ability to function on multidisciplinary teams, (c) an understanding of professional and ethical responsibility, (d) an ability to communicate effectively, (e) the broad education necessary to understand the impact of solutions in a global and societal context, (f) a recognition of the need for and an ability to engage in life-long learning, and (g) a knowledge of contemporary issues. Many of these outcomes will be addressed through both the Molecular Engineering degree curriculum (emphasized in the design sequence and the research colloquium) and the College general education requirements. Students who are able to both develop and articulate these skills will be positioned favorably for employment in industry and for postgraduate study (engineering, medicine, law, and business administration). Entering the Program Students must indicate their intent to pursue the BS program at the end of the Autumn Quarter in their second year of study by completing the Intent to Pursue Molecular Engineering questionnaire (available on the IME website). They begin the engineering curriculum in the following Spring Quarter with enrollment in either MENG 26010 Engineering Principles of Conservation or MENG 26020 Engineering Electrodynamics. Both courses require the completion of their stated prerequisites. Students should work with their advisers early in their first year of study to plan for those prerequisites to be completed in a timely manner.

The overall objective of the program is to provide basic engineering tools and ways of thinking to students that augment scientific approaches and problem solving skills. Minor Program Requirements Before a student can declare the minor in molecular engineering, the student must: Complete the general education requirements in mathematics and physical or biological sciences Earn a B or higher in MENG 20000 Introduction to Emerging Technologies Following completion of the general education requirements and MENG 20000 Introduction to Emerging Technologies (with a grade of B or better), students may apply to the director of undergraduate studies of the Institute for Molecular Engineering for admission into the minor in molecular engineering program. A student must receive the director of undergraduate studies’ approval of the minor program on a form obtained from the student's College adviser. Once signed by the director, this form must then be returned to the student's College adviser by the end of Spring Quarter of the student's third year. To earn the minor in molecular engineering, a student must complete five molecular engineering courses chosen in consultation with the director of undergraduate studies. Before meeting with the director, students should invest some thought into which courses they would like to complete for the minor and how those courses relate as a set. MENG 20000 Introduction to Emerging Technologies and MENG 29700 Undergraduate Research for Molecular Engineering must be among the five courses counted toward the minor. In rare cases, courses offered by other departments and programs may be approved by the director of undergraduate studies as substitutes for courses listed above. Courses in the minor program may not be (1) double counted with the student's major(s) or with other minors, or (2) counted toward general education requirements. Courses in the minor must be taken for quality grades, and more than half of the requirements for the minor must be met by registering for courses bearing University of Chicago course numbers.

Students majoring in Molecular Engineering must receive quality grades in all courses required in the degree program. All courses in the minor must be taken for quality grades. Nonmajors and nonminors may take Molecular Engineering courses on a P/F basis; only grades of C- or higher constitute passing work. Honors Students who pursue a substantive research project with a faculty member of the Institute for Molecular Engineering are encouraged to write and defend an honors thesis based on their work. Students who wish to be considered for honors are expected to complete their arrangements with the director of undergraduate studies before the end of their third year and to register for one quarter of MENG 29700 Undergraduate Research for Molecular Engineering during their third or fourth years. To be eligible to receive honors, students in the BS degree program must write a creditable honors paper describing their research. The paper must be submitted before the deadline established by the director of undergraduate studies and must be approved by the department chairperson. In addition, an oral presentation of the research is required. The research paper or project used to meet this requirement may not be used to meet the BA/BS paper or project requirement in another major. To earn a BS degree with honors in Molecular Engineering, students must also have an overall GPA of 3.0 or higher. Molecular Engineering Courses MENG 20000.

For companies, such liability can at best result in plummeting share prices, and at worst the shutting down of an enterprise. For individuals, they can result in incarceration, fines, penalties and removal from the business. While many of the principles apply to all industries, the seminar will explore the regulatory and legal foundations for these programs primarily through the lens of the financial services sector, which includes banks, brokerage firms, investment companies and investment advisers.

China is growing stronger and more influential in every domain worldwide and likely to increasingly threaten the status quo. The U.S., meanwhile, finds itself in the grips of a populist movement led by President Trump, who is openly critical of China. The relationship, which was already mistrustful, has grown even more fragile and anxious in recent weeks with talk of tariffs, Taiwan, and the South China Sea. The accusations and threats suggest that we are likely to witness greater turbulence than what we have experienced in the past forty years. The reality is that both nations need each other; both have significant economic, political, and security interests at stake. If the two nations learn how to collaborate, they could conceivably solve the world’s greatest problems. Alternatively, if they elect to contest each other at every turn, the result will be global instability and crisis. Clearly, a new framework for cooperation and collaboration is needed – quite possibly “a new deal,” in the language of President Trump. What will constitute such a deal? How will it work? How likely is a deal, and, if one does occur, will it survive the volatility of an America First foreign policy? This seminar will advocate that the two nations develop a new, fifty-year treaty in the form of a strategic cooperation agreement. We will define the rationale and the case for action, draft major components of the proposed treaty, outline the pathway required for adoption, and transmit our end-product to foreign policy authorities in Washington and Beijing.

In this course we try to understand these emotional attachments by examining the narrative of loss and redemption through which most nations in the Balkans retell their Ottoman past. We begin by considering the mythic temporality of the Romantic national narrative while focusing on specific national literary texts where the national past is retold through the formula of original wholeness, foreign invasion, Passion, and Salvation. We then proceed to unpack the structural role of the different elements of that narrative. With the help of Žižek’s theory of the subject as constituted by trauma, we think about the national fixation on the trauma of loss, and the role of trauma in the formation of national consciousness. Specific theme inquiries involve the figure of the Janissary as self and other, brotherhood and fratricide, and the writing of the national trauma on the individual physical body. Special attention is given to the general aesthetic of victimhood, the casting of the victimized national self as the object of the “other’s perverse desire.” With the help of Freud, Žižek, and Kant we consider the transformation of national victimhood into the sublimity of the national self.

Contemporary critics often consider this novel the archetypal fictional work about terrorism, as it is based on the bomb attack that occurred in Greenwich in 1888. The Secret Agent demonstrates, however, much more than its prophetic significance rediscovered after 9/11. Therefore, the course seeks how the novel’s relevance stems in equal measure from Conrad’s interest in a wider political process and his distrust of state power; in particular, the course explores how these forces determine the individual caught in a confining situation. We read The Secret Agent as a political novel, that struggle for solutions defies chaos as well as an imposition of a single ideology or one authorial point of view. Its ambiguities and political antinomies allow for interdisciplinary readings that also present an opportunity to critically overview the established approaches to main Conradian themes. In analyzing the formation of the narrative’s ideology we discuss Conrad’s historical pessimism that demonstrates with sustained irony how capitalism breeds social injustice that, in turn, breeds anarchism.

We will especially focus on how the work explores the intersection of legal and literary representation but students will be encouraged to further explore in individual projects the many topics raised by the text, including (and in addition to the themes mentioned above) magic, the visual arts, mercantile culture, travel and discovery, and new religious practices.", "instructor": "Justin Steinberg", "sectionid": "[54800]", "section": "1", "career": "Undergraduate", "type": "SEM"}, "MUSI33800": {"daytime": "Wed : 09:30 AM-12:20 PM", "name": "Ethnographic Methods", "subsections": [], "location": "Regenstein Library 264", "condition": "Open", "description": "The topic of this seminar varies per faculty member.", "instructor": "Jessica Baker", "sectionid": "[43732]", "section": "1", "career": "Graduate", "type": "SEM"}, "CHDV37202": {"daytime": "Fri : 09:30 AM-12:20 PM", "name": "Language In Culture-2", "subsections": [], "location": "Haskell Hall 315", "condition": "Open", "description": "The second half of the sequence takes up basic concepts in sociolinguistics and their critique.", "instructor": "Staff", "sectionid": "[43521]", "section": "1", "career": "Graduate", "type": "SEM"}, "HIST25506": {"daytime": "Tue : 12:00 PM-02:50 PM", "name": "Science and Aesthetics in the 18th-21st Centuries", "subsections": [], "location": "TBA", "condition": "Open", "description": "One can distinguish four ways in which science and aesthetics are related during the period since the Renaissance.

Third, aesthetic means have been used to convey scientific conceptions (e.g., through illustrations in scientific volumes or through aesthetically affective and effective writing). Finally, philosophers have stepped back to consider the relationship between scientific knowing and aesthetic comprehension (e.g., Kant, Bas van Fraassen); much of the discussion of this latter will focus on the relation between images and what they represent.

Direct Client Service: Pursuant to federal law, the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, the Young Center is appointed as Child Advocate for the most vulnerable of these children (tender age children, children with mental or physical disabilities, children who have experienced extensive trauma, etc.). Law students serve as Child Advocate for individual children, and are responsible for advocating for the best interests of the assigned child on issues relating to safe repatriation, legal relief, care, custody and release. Each student meets weekly with the child at the detention facility, and advocates on behalf of the child with federal officials, including immigration judges and asylum officers, under the supervision of Young Center attorneys. Since there currently is no substantive best interests of the child standard under the Immigration and Nationality Act, students look to international human rights law, including the Convention on the Rights of the Child, state child welfare law, and the child protection laws of the child’s home country. Policy Advocacy: In addition to serving as Child Advocate, clinic students have the opportunity to engage in legislative and policy advocacy aimed at improving the immigration system for children in removal proceedings. This is an especially critical time since the government projects 70,000 children will arrive at the border this year. Young Center students will do policy advocacy aimed at reforming procedural and substantive legal protections, including the appointment of counsel for immigrant children and incorporation of a substantive best interests of the child standard in the Immigration and Nationality Act.

The Secret Agent demonstrates, however, much more than its prophetic significance rediscovered after 9/11. Therefore, the course seeks how the novel’s relevance stems in equal measure from Conrad’s interest in a wider political process and his distrust of state power; in particular, the course explores how these forces determine the individual caught in a confining situation. We read The Secret Agent as a political novel, that struggle for solutions defies chaos as well as an imposition of a single ideology or one authorial point of view. Its ambiguities and political antinomies allow for interdisciplinary readings that also present an opportunity to critically overview the established approaches to main Conradian themes. In analyzing the formation of the narrative’s ideology we discuss Conrad’s historical pessimism that demonstrates with sustained irony how capitalism breeds social injustice that, in turn, breeds anarchism. The class also focuses on how the novel exposes duplicity in staging surveillance, terrorism, as well as adjacent forms of violence or sacrifice.

Most sessions are led by visiting speakers, from either outside institutions or our own faculty, who circulate their papers in advance. The session consists of a brief introduction by the speaker, followed by initial questioning by the two faculty coordinators, followed by general discussion, in which students are given priority. The topic for 2016-17 will expose students to cutting-edge work in general jurisprudence, that part of philosophy of law concerned with the central questions about the nature of law, the relationship between law and morality, and the nature of legal reasoning. We will be particularly interested in the way in which work in philosophy of language, metaethics, metaphysics, and other cognate fields of philosophy has influenced recent scholarly debates that have arisen in the wake of H.L.A. Hart’s seminal The Concept of Law (1961). Please see www.law.uchicago.edu/workshops/lawandphilosophy for additional information concerning each session. Usual participants include graduate students in philosophy, political science, and divinity, and law students. Students write a 20-25 page seminar paper at the end of the year. The paper may satisfy the Law School Substantial Writing Requirement. Students must enroll for all three quarters to receive credit. Students are admitted by permission of the instructors.

We begin by considering the mythic temporality of the Romantic national narrative while focusing on specific national literary texts where the national past is retold through the formula of original wholeness, foreign invasion, Passion, and Salvation. We then proceed to unpack the structural role of the different elements of that narrative. With the help of Žižek’s theory of the subject as constituted by trauma, we think about the national fixation on the trauma of loss, and the role of trauma in the formation of national consciousness. Specific theme inquiries involve the figure of the Janissary as self and other, brotherhood and fratricide, and the writing of the national trauma on the individual physical body. Special attention is given to the general aesthetic of victimhood, the casting of the victimized national self as the object of the “other’s perverse desire.” With the help of Freud, Žižek, and Kant we consider the transformation of national victimhood into the sublimity of the national self.

Our guiding inquiries will be simultaneously interpretive, theoretical, and historical: What does it mean to think of form as an “exteriorization” of one’s “will”? Whose will do these forms represent (who is the “us” in Rivera’s “our will”)? What representational strategies enable this exteriorization and dramatize its limitations?

Developments in Islamic thought will be considered in the context of global trends, from the rise of liberalism, nationalism, and socialism to the liberation movements of the twentieth century and the confusion sewn by humanitarian crises of an unprecedented scale. Amidst these dramatic shifts in the geopolitical landscape, how have Muslim thinkers sought to ground their demands for dignity, autonomy, justice, and recognition? What do such claims have to do with the pursuit of personal and collective piety, on the one hand, and spiritual transcendence, on the other? Rather than framing Muslim political thinkers as reacting to global modernity, we understand them as key actors in shaping it, and our study of their writings will be oriented toward achieving a better understanding of the modern era as a whole.

After taking this course, you should improve your ability to determine a firm's accounting policy for a particular type of transaction and to determine how that policy choice affects its primary financial statements. You will also learn how to question whether these effects fairly reflect the underlying economics of the firm's transactions. Asking these questions involves an interplay between accounting, economics, finance, law and business strategy. You should therefore greatly improve your ability to use an accounting report as part of an overall assessment of the firm's strategy and the potential rewards and risks of dealing with the firm. The teaching approach will be a roughly equal combination of lecture time and demanding case applications of the lecture material that will involve group case assignments that will form the basis for in-class discussion of the cases. The technical knowledge acquired from the lecture material is applied to cases where the main goal is to examine how the reported financial statements would differ if the firm had used different accounting policies. The focus is on modifying the reported financial statements in order to obtain the cleanest possible inputs for use in such applications as equity valuation, transaction structuring and credit analysis.

Historians of religion often begin by turning to texts: either sacred texts, or, in the absence of such scriptures, descriptions of belief and practice by observers from outside the faith. Archaeologists focus their attention on the spaces and traces of religious practice—or at least those that survive—while art historians begin by examining images of deities and religious rites. Yet we often fail to see the extent to which the questions which we ask of all of these diverse sources are conditioned by Christian rhetoric about pagan worship. In this course, we compare two moments when Christians encountered \"pagans\": during the initial Christian construction of a discourse on paganism (and, more broadly, a discourse on religion) during the late Roman empire and during the Spanish discovery of the New World. Our course examines silences and absences in the textual and material records, as well as the divergences between texts and objects, in order to further our understanding of ancient religious practice.

It is an atmosphere, mood or perhaps a theme that movies have explores since nearly the beginning of cinema (or perhaps even before..) To explore this term this class will draw largely on a tradition of commentary on the German word Das Unheimliche, usually translated as uncanny, that can be traced among Ernst Jentsch, Sigmund Freud, and Martin Heidegger and its relevance to film studies. Freud and his disciple Otto Rank before 1920 related the uncanny to the cinema, and cinema’s ability to evoke the uncanny has been frequently observed. On the one hand, the cinema’s ability to portray uncanny events (as in Rank and Freud’s invocation of the 1913 film the Student in Prague) appears generically in films of fantasy or horror. In addition, some theorists have felt that film as a medium could be best approached via the uncanny. In this class, we will read a series of the key texts and try to survey the terrain of the concept of the uncanny. We will screen films that evoke the experience through their narrative and stylistics, and we will discuss the usefulness of the term for theorizing both film and electronic media, both new and old.", "instructor": "Thomas R Gunning", "sectionid": "[43909]", "section": "1", "career": "Undergraduate", "type": "LEC"}, "MDVS69000": {"daytime": "TBA", "name": "Special Course  Seabury-Western", "subsections": [], "location": "TBA", "condition": "Open", "description": "", "instructor": "Teresa Owens", "sectionid": "[41669]", "section": "3", "career": "Graduate", "type": "LEC"}, "CCTS38300": {"daytime": "Tue Thu : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM", "name": "Health Economics and Public Policy", "subsections": [], "location": "TBA", "condition": "Open", "description": "This course analyzes the economics of health and medical care in the United States with particular attention to the role of government.

On the other, the treatment of these recurring themes according to established “rules” of the mystery genre has helped promote the creation of a reading public that shares a set of taboos and mores. Meanwhile, the problems tackled incisively by Japanese mystery works are often reflections of the larger societal problems posed by their time—including Westernization, imperial expansion, defeat in the Second World War, the arrival of economic prosperity, the collapse of the bubble economy, political corruption, and a perception of decline in the cohesiveness of community.

We then consider imperial debates over taxation in the 1760s and 1770s, returning Benjamin Franklin’s Autobiography to its original context. Reading Paine’s Common Sense and the letters of Abigail Adams and John Adams we look at the multiple meanings of independence.
