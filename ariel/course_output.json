This, in many ways, reflects the narrative eighteenth-century writers were developing about their own age. For British Whigs, the “Glorious Revolution” of 1688 had been a watershed moment at which the arbitrary rule of kings had been replaced for all time by constitutionalism; the social contract and the civil polity had triumphed over divine-right ideology, ushering in a new, beneficent era of progress. And, in the 1790s, the French Revolution fired the political imaginations of British radicals who saw the potential for a world made anew – a world of universal suffrage and gender equality, where slavery was abolished. Clearly, attaining these goals was a long way off. The debates over the structures, meanings, and nature of consent had tendrils in multiple areas of society – the law, of course, but also in understandings of sexuality, constructions of gender, economics, and colonization. Questions of rights, agency, and authority (what those categories meant, who could possess them, and who guaranteed them) were by no means settled, and, indeed, throughout the century, calls to curtail the categories of people who should have access to the sphere of political influence were often as boisterous as those to expand such access. This course will explore how a range of authors in eighteenth-century Britain figured questions of consent, rights, and authority and how the ideological debates these authors mediated continue to inform contemporary politics, cultures, and identities. We will read works by literary figures such as Daniel Defoe, Samuel Richardson, Mary Hays, Olaudah Equiano, and Mary Shelley. We will consider the writings of some of the major political philosophers of the day, as well, including John Locke, Thomas Hobbes, Mary Astell, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Thomas Paine, and Mary Wollstonecraft.

Indeed, it is guaranteed in the very etymology of the French and German words “mode” and “modernité”. Yet, on closer inspection, there is a blind spot in this relation in that fashion seems rather to be the Other of modernity than modernity itself, an Oriental colony in the heart of the West. The modern discourse of fashion testifies to the ambivalences and paradoxes in this relationship. From the beginning of the modern world until now, it is strangely split: there is fashion and fashion. Properly speaking, men’s fashion is not really fashionable. The perfectly functional suit without superfluous adornment is, in its world-wide constancy through the centuries, almost invariably classical. Its staggering universal success is due to the fact that it is the ideal modern dress: beautiful, because functional. Women’s fashion, on the contrary, is a remnant of the old, effeminate aristocracy – a frivolous frill, an all-in-all dysfunctional ornament, badly in need of thorough modernization. The „new woman“ is born in agonizing pain and perpetual fallbacks: while Chanel almost lead us toward a functional feminine form, Dior’s new look was, from this perspective, a setback: it brought back the unhealthy, restrictive corset and offered a slap in the face to the modern aesthetic dogma of „form follows function“. Fashion therefore seems to be the locus of a strange intimation of the political set against the common politics of modernity. By reading texts form Friedrich Nietzsche to Adolf Loos and Thorstein Veblen, Rousseau to Baudelaire, from Gautier, Zola and Apollinaire to Simone de Beauvoir and Pierre Bourdieu, the course will center around this blind spot between fashion and modernity and the new gendering of fashion in the bourgeois, post-feudal era.", "subsections": [], "condition": "Open", "sectionid": "[53927]", "name": "Fashion and Modernity", "location": "Classics Building 313", "type": "SEM", "career": "Undergraduate", "section": "1"}, "SSAD44212": {"daytime": "Thu : 09:00 AM-11:50 AM", "instructor": "Shipra Parikh", "description": "", "subsections": [], "condition": "Closed", "sectionid": "[42667]", "name": "Abuse-Focused Child Therapy & The Helping Relationship", "location": "TBA", "type": "LEC", "career": "Graduate", "section": "1"}, "RUSS30302": {"daytime": "Mon Wed Fri : 12:30 PM-01:20 PM", "instructor": "Valentina Pichugin", "description": "This course, which is designed for fifth-year students of Russian, covers various aspects of Russian stylistics and discourse grammar in context.

In Catalunya, a small country, theater was the national defense during Franco’s dictatorship and in the present times serves as a nationalist weapon to claim independence. In this course, we will explore the history of Catalunya and Europe through theater, by means of written literature and footage of performances which will make lectures more dynamic and attractive. Also, we will meet the personal dramas of women and their social and historical implications through the theory of gender. Theater is a recreational and collective way of understanding a culture, thus it will be proposed to the students the possibility of creating a short play written and performed by them. Methodologically, the course is multifaceted and intertextual. The analysis tools are comparatist, historical, political, linguistic, psychiatric, and philosophical; the approach is creative (writing and acting) and related to cultural studies and feminism.

At the end of the twentieth century, the predominant view was that democracy had triumphed over fascism and communism and was secure in its standing as the sole legitimate mode of modern politics. Political theorists skeptical of this view argued that what had triumphed was not properly ‘democracy’ at all, often because political practice in modern democracies failed to measure up to a classical ideal. We will investigate uses of the ancient Greek past by modern critics of the theory and practice of liberal democratic politics. With a focus on post-war theorists like Hannah Arendt, Bernard Williams, and Pierre Hadot, we will ask how recovering aspects of the classical tradition might revitalize the modern theoretical and practical political landscape. By elucidating the political motivations behind, and implications of, the use of the ancient Greeks by these and other thinkers, we will clarify post-war critiques of the theory and practice of modern democratic politics that continue to influence theorists today.", "subsections": [], "condition": "Open", "sectionid": "[41782]", "name": "Democracy, Ancient and Modern", "location": "TBA", "type": "SEM", "career": "Undergraduate", "section": "1"}, "EALC22024": {"daytime": "Tue Thu : 12:00 PM-01:20 PM", "instructor": "Nicholas Lambrecht", "description": "This course explores the shifting forms of Japanese mystery fiction and the functions the mystery genre has served both within modern Japanese literature and in Japanese mass culture as a whole. On the one hand, mystery writing in Japanese has proven to be a resilient and popular brand of “low” culture, often excluded from the realm of “pure” literature due to its focus on violence, lawlessness, and perversity. On the other, the treatment of these recurring themes according to established “rules” of the mystery genre has helped promote the creation of a reading public that shares a set of taboos and mores. Meanwhile, the problems tackled incisively by Japanese mystery works are often reflections of the larger societal problems posed by their time—including Westernization, imperial expansion, defeat in the Second World War, the arrival of economic prosperity, the collapse of the bubble economy, political corruption, and a perception of decline in the cohesiveness of community. Through examining mysteries, we will hope to arrive at a better understanding of how Japanese literature and society speak to and alter one another.

This, in many ways, reflects the narrative eighteenth-century writers were developing about their own age. For British Whigs, the “Glorious Revolution” of 1688 had been a watershed moment at which the arbitrary rule of kings had been replaced for all time by constitutionalism; the social contract and the civil polity had triumphed over divine-right ideology, ushering in a new, beneficent era of progress. And, in the 1790s, the French Revolution fired the political imaginations of British radicals who saw the potential for a world made anew – a world of universal suffrage and gender equality, where slavery was abolished. Clearly, attaining these goals was a long way off. The debates over the structures, meanings, and nature of consent had tendrils in multiple areas of society – the law, of course, but also in understandings of sexuality, constructions of gender, economics, and colonization. Questions of rights, agency, and authority (what those categories meant, who could possess them, and who guaranteed them) were by no means settled, and, indeed, throughout the century, calls to curtail the categories of people who should have access to the sphere of political influence were often as boisterous as those to expand such access. This course will explore how a range of authors in eighteenth-century Britain figured questions of consent, rights, and authority and how the ideological debates these authors mediated continue to inform contemporary politics, cultures, and identities.

The course takes seriously the interplay of ethnographic inquiry and theory building and of professional practice and public engagement in the development of anthropology as a modern (and postmodern) discipline. While many of the concepts explored here will be recognizable as part of the “bread and butter” of anthropological research, the course is less interested in providing a comprehensive survey of 20th century anthropology than in interrogating the discipline’s signature style of theory building through ethnographic engagements in “the field.” We start from the premise that anthropological theory is a dialectical practice through which realist arguments about the historical world(s)—and the human’s place in it—are honed through empirical encounters and pushback from anthropology’s ethnographic subjects. Ultimately, the course hopes to track how anthropological ways of knowing intervene in the world through the making and stabilizing of particular lived concepts; that is, we ask after theory’s historical formation and durable effects, its social life, as well as afterlives, in the discipline and beyond.", "subsections": [], "condition": "Open", "sectionid": "[43427]", "name": "Develop Social Cultural Thry-1", "location": "Wilder House 101", "type": "SEM", "career": "Graduate", "section": "1"}, "ECON39701": {"daytime": "Mon : 01:30 PM-04:30 PM", "instructor": "Zhiguo He", "description": "Course Search", "subsections": [], "condition": "Open", "sectionid": "[54745]", "name": "Advanced Theory of Corporate Finance and Capital Markets", "location": "Charles M.

Most antitrust issues have been back and forth to the Supreme Court repeatedly. This allows students to see how succeeding generations of great judges have wrestled with the core issues in the field.

This course will examine this three-hundred-year history by investigating the following essential questions: (1) How did a collection of diverse kingdoms manage to create a global empire? (2) What specific factors can explain the Spanish decline of the seventeenth century? (3) Was the Spanish Empire doomed to fail from the very beginning? (4) Why did many colonial subjects remain loyal to Spain after the Conquest and especially after a century of decline? (5) Why did the empire collapse only after 1808? In our exploration of these questions, we will pay particular attention to Spain's ambitious and pioneering, if also destructive, involvement with conquest, colonial exploitation, chattel slavery, racial domination, and a mission to \"civilize\" the world. We will then proceed to investigate the Spanish decline of the seventeenth century and the influence of the emerging empires of Britain, France, and the Dutch Republic.

Psychotherapy for persons presenting with chronic distress present a unique set of challenges. Most research in psychotherapy outcomes suggest that one of the most important factors associated with successful treatment is the relationship between the client and therapist. Traditionally, focus on the therapeutic relationship has been the purview of experiential and psychodynamic therapies. However, in the past ten years, three behavioral models of psychotherapy have been introduced that focus on the relationship in the therapy session. To varying degrees, these therapies are based on a large body of knowledge developed over the past several decades in the study of verbal behavior. In this class, participants will be introduced to a behavioral conceptualization of phenomena such as emotion, memory, cognition, and beliefs. Discussion of these private behaviors will conclude in a presentation of a behavioral theory of the “sense of self”. For the remainder of the course, participants will revisit these concepts as they apply to discussion of three influential behavioral therapies. First, participants will become acquainted with specific clinician behaviors that foster the curative role of the therapist as articulated in Functional Analytic Psychotherapy (FAP) developed by Robert Kohlenberg. Second, participants will discuss the role of verbal behavior in human suffering and the “recontextualization” of painful private experience presented in Acceptance and Commitment Therapy developed by Steven Hayes. Finally, participants will be introduced to the therapeutic dialectic of acceptance and change as outlined in Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) developed by Marsha Linehan. The goal of the course will be to briefly introduce participants to FAP and ACT and to provide an overview of the principles and strategies of DBT that explicitly address the diffuse, troubling experiences presented by most chronically distressed individuals.", "subsections": [], "condition": "Closed", "sectionid": "[42614]", "name": "Fundamentals of Behavioral Therapy:  Contemporary Approaches", "location": "TBA", "type": "LEC", "career": "Graduate", "section": "2"}, "HMRT26501": {"daytime": "Mon Wed : 03:00 PM-04:20 PM", "instructor": "Emma Mackinnon", "description": "On a certain conception of the international, the world consists of a collection of sovereign, territorial states, facing off against one another in more or less warlike ways.

Our guiding inquiries will be simultaneously interpretive, theoretical, and historical: What does it mean to think of form as an “exteriorization” of one’s “will”? Whose will do these forms represent (who is the “us” in Rivera’s “our will”)? What representational strategies enable this exteriorization and dramatize its limitations? Why was the novel so often singled out, and why did some feminist writers prefer instead a collection of letters, poems, journal entries, and personal essays? These questions will inform our study of the consolidation of a self-conscious Chicago literature and its attendant literary history. Students of the course will therefore not only become familiar with exciting works of textual art, they will also study the institutional context that enables the consolidation of “a literature,” and a “literary history.” Authors will include José Antonio Villarreal, Tomás Rivera, Rudolfo Anaya, Cherríe Moraga, Ana Castillo, and Gloria Anzaldúa.

Both are composed of prevailing ethnoreligious groups and religious and ethnic minorities that challenge the dominant structure from within and at their borders.

We then proceed to unpack the structural role of the different elements of that narrative. With the help of Žižek’s theory of the subject as constituted by trauma, we think about the national fixation on the trauma of loss, and the role of trauma in the formation of national consciousness. Specific theme inquiries involve the figure of the Janissary as self and other, brotherhood and fratricide, and the writing of the national trauma on the individual physical body. Special attention is given to the general aesthetic of victimhood, the casting of the victimized national self as the object of the “other’s perverse desire.” With the help of Freud, Žižek, and Kant we consider the transformation of national victimhood into the sublimity of the national self.

From this perspective, slavery can only be a relation of domination or as a vanishing moment before the enslaved contracts into servitude. In the process of installing this perspective, philosophical modernity foreclosed myriad philosophical and legal traditions of self-enslavement at the precise moment that slavery itself was generalized as the Atlantic world’s foundational mode of political and social relation.

This, in many ways, reflects the narrative eighteenth-century writers were developing about their own age. For British Whigs, the “Glorious Revolution” of 1688 had been a watershed moment at which the arbitrary rule of kings had been replaced for all time by constitutionalism; the social contract and the civil polity had triumphed over divine-right ideology, ushering in a new, beneficent era of progress. And, in the 1790s, the French Revolution fired the political imaginations of British radicals who saw the potential for a world made anew – a world of universal suffrage and gender equality, where slavery was abolished. Clearly, attaining these goals was a long way off. The debates over the structures, meanings, and nature of consent had tendrils in multiple areas of society – the law, of course, but also in understandings of sexuality, constructions of gender, economics, and colonization. Questions of rights, agency, and authority (what those categories meant, who could possess them, and who guaranteed them) were by no means settled, and, indeed, throughout the century, calls to curtail the categories of people who should have access to the sphere of political influence were often as boisterous as those to expand such access. This course will explore how a range of authors in eighteenth-century Britain figured questions of consent, rights, and authority and how the ideological debates these authors mediated continue to inform contemporary politics, cultures, and identities. We will read works by literary figures such as Daniel Defoe, Samuel Richardson, Mary Hays, Olaudah Equiano, and Mary Shelley. We will consider the writings of some of the major political philosophers of the day, as well, including John Locke, Thomas Hobbes, Mary Astell, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Thomas Paine, and Mary Wollstonecraft.

The Secret Agent demonstrates, however, much more than its prophetic significance rediscovered after 9/11. Therefore, the course seeks how the novel’s relevance stems in equal measure from Conrad’s interest in a wider political process and his distrust of state power; in particular, the course explores how these forces determine the individual caught in a confining situation. We read The Secret Agent as a political novel, that struggle for solutions defies chaos as well as an imposition of a single ideology or one authorial point of view. Its ambiguities and political antinomies allow for interdisciplinary readings that also present an opportunity to critically overview the established approaches to main Conradian themes. In analyzing the formation of the narrative’s ideology we discuss Conrad’s historical pessimism that demonstrates with sustained irony how capitalism breeds social injustice that, in turn, breeds anarchism. The class also focuses on how the novel exposes duplicity in staging surveillance, terrorism, as well as adjacent forms of violence or sacrifice.

In the class actions, the Clinic represents groups of employees in employment and civil rights actions in federal court. Additionally, in its individual cases and law reform/impact cases, the Clinic seeks to improve the procedures and remedies available to victims of employment discrimination so that employees have a fair opportunity to present their claims in a reasonably expeditious way. To accomplish this goal, the Clinic is active in the legislative arena and participates with other civil rights groups in efforts to amend and improve state and federal laws.

The Secret Agent demonstrates, however, much more than its prophetic significance rediscovered after 9/11. Therefore, the course seeks how the novel’s relevance stems in equal measure from Conrad’s interest in a wider political process and his distrust of state power; in particular, the course explores how these forces determine the individual caught in a confining situation. We read The Secret Agent as a political novel, that struggle for solutions defies chaos as well as an imposition of a single ideology or one authorial point of view. Its ambiguities and political antinomies allow for interdisciplinary readings that also present an opportunity to critically overview the established approaches to main Conradian themes. In analyzing the formation of the narrative’s ideology we discuss Conrad’s historical pessimism that demonstrates with sustained irony how capitalism breeds social injustice that, in turn, breeds anarchism.

The tools of engineering are important in making and translating basic discoveries in other fields into new intellectual opportunities and, sometimes, useful technologies. Institute for Molecular Engineering The Institute for Molecular Engineering (IME) is founded on the principle of collaborative problem-solving, not rigid academic disciplines. It is at the forefront of an emerging field that has the potential to address fundamental problems of societal import. This exciting new field involves the incorporation of synthetic molecular building blocks into functional systems that will impact technologies from advanced medical therapies to quantum computing. Created in partnership with Argonne National Laboratory, the IME builds on the tradition of collaboration and cutting-edge research well established at Argonne and the University of Chicago. It conducts research at the intersection of chemical, electrical, mechanical, and biological engineering, as well as materials, biological, and physical sciences. The institute’s exploration of innovative technologies in nanoscale manipulation and design at a molecular scale has the potential for impact in such areas as energy, health care, and the environment. Major Program in Molecular Engineering The BS degree program in Molecular Engineering offers undergraduates a cutting-edge engineering curriculum built on a strong foundation in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology. Courses are designed to develop quantitative reasoning and problem-solving skills; to introduce engineering analysis of physical, chemical, and biological systems; and to address open-ended technological questions across a spectrum of disciplines. The program will both prepare undergraduates for a wide variety of careers in technology-focused industries and position graduates for further postgraduate study in such fields as science, engineering, medicine, business, or law. The aim is to introduce invention and design, along with inquiry and discovery, as fruitful and complementary intellectual activities. Majors are able to choose from two quantitative engineering analysis tracks, one aimed at engineering with a biological, chemical, and soft materials emphasis, and one geared toward applied physics. The applied physics track, offered in close collaboration with the Department of Physics, is one of the first initiatives worldwide to formally educate quantum engineers at the undergraduate level. MENG 29500 Engineering Design is a 300-unit design course offered as a capstone, in which student teams spend an intensive quarter working with a faculty mentor to solve an open-ended problem, for example, analyzing chemical and biological properties of cancer cells to develop new treatment and delivery vehicles or harnessing the properties of electrons in materials to develop quantum information technologies. The course also combines technical skills with an exploration of economics, regulatory and legal issues, and ethics. Major Program Requirements 1. A strong and broad background in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology. It is imperative for a modern engineer to have a strong and broad background in the sciences. Traditional engineering disciplines have had requirements in math, chemistry, and physics for decades and many programs have evolved to require biology as well. The highly interdisciplinary nature of Molecular Engineering requires a foundation built across the mathematical, physical, and biological sciences. Students are encouraged to complete their general education requirements at the highest level for which they are prepared. This will position them better to take advantage of advanced electives and research opportunities. As discussed in more detail below, there will be two tracks for Molecular Engineering majors, one aimed towards engineering with a biological, chemical, and soft materials emphasis, and one aimed towards applied physics. Students in the former track will follow precedent set by Chemistry and Biological Sciences majors in that they will likely take chemistry in year 1, physics in year 2, and follow the recommended mathematics courses in the Chemistry curriculum. Students in the latter track will follow precedent set by Physics majors in that they will likely take physics in year 1, follow the mathematics guidelines of Physics majors, and take chemistry in year 2. 2. MENG 26030 Introduction to Engineering Analysis. One of the first courses for all Molecular Engineering majors, this course teaches students to apply mathematical methods towards solving problems that cut across multiple engineering sub-disciplines. A major objective of the course is to teach simple programming skills and computational methods in applied mathematics, including the use of engineering software such as Matlab, Mathematica, Comsol, and elements of Python. The skills that are introduced here will be further developed and strengthened throughout the rest of the curriculum. 3. Two quantitative engineering analysis tracks: Biological, Chemical, and Soft Materials Engineering and Quantum Engineering. Reflecting the research and education themes of the IME, two highly intertwined but recognizably different tracks for the major are available to students. One is aimed at preparing students oriented towards biological, chemical, and soft materials engineering, and the other is aimed at preparing students oriented towards engineering of quantum-based materials, devices, and processes. The latter track is offered in close collaboration with the Department of Physics. The main difference in the tracks relates to a choice between two sequences of three courses under the heading of quantitative engineering analysis. 4. MENG 29500 Engineering Design (300-unit capstone course). This “immersion” design course teaches students how to bring combinations of fundamental science and engineering together to solve open-ended and challenging engineering problems. It also serves as a vehicle to teach other equally important non-technical skills, including: • Problem identification: technology analysis, competitive analysis, market analysis, stakeholder analysis, product definition • Impact of the project, including sociological and engineering ethics • Project planning • Project economics: costs, value/investment analysis, risk analysis and adjustment • Prototyping, experimental design, data analysis, error analysis • IP: patenting, prior art, patentability • Legal and regulatory analysis • Proposing, presenting and reporting • Teamwork IME faculty and fellows will propose open-ended projects for which they will serve as mentors. Students will work together in groups of three. 5. Materials and advanced electives (3 required courses in the major). The major is offered in such a way as to allow for considerable flexibility for students to tailor their programs along individualized trajectories, with help from faculty advisors. Not only can students choose between two tracks, but they can further build breadth or depth through their choice of a materials course and advanced electives. Moreover, we anticipate that our students will use their general electives outside of the major requirements to strengthen their backgrounds in specific areas of interest, also in consultation with Molecular Engineering advisors, to achieve desired outcomes such as preparation for graduate school in more traditional engineering disciplines. 6. Laboratory skills and hands-on experience. Critical skills that molecular engineers must acquire as part of their educational program include the ability to apply knowledge of mathematics, science, and engineering and the ability to design and conduct experiments, as well as the ability to analyze and interpret data. Molecular Engineering majors develop these skills through lab components associated with required courses in the physical and biological sciences, Molecular Engineering courses including MENG 26101-26102 Transport Phenomena I: Forces + Flows; Transport Phenomena II, MENG 26201-26202 Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics I-II, MENG 29500 Engineering Design, and some of the advanced electives such as MENG 27300 Polymer Physics and Engineering. We also anticipate that many Molecular Engineering students will receive advanced laboratory experience pursuing undergraduate research projects. 7. Non-technical skills. Many decades of workshops and panels engaging stakeholders in academia and industry, often associated with the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET), have identified criteria for outcomes of students in accredited engineering education programs. Although there is no thought of seeking ABET accreditation for the Molecular Engineering major, many ABET criteria, particularly those related to non-technological skills, are viewed as essential to incorporate into the Molecular Engineering major. Examples of student outcomes that fall into this category include: (a) an ability to formulate or design a system, process, or program to meet desired needs, (b) an ability to function on multidisciplinary teams, (c) an understanding of professional and ethical responsibility, (d) an ability to communicate effectively, (e) the broad education necessary to understand the impact of solutions in a global and societal context, (f) a recognition of the need for and an ability to engage in life-long learning, and (g) a knowledge of contemporary issues. Many of these outcomes will be addressed through both the Molecular Engineering degree curriculum (emphasized in the design sequence and the research colloquium) and the College general education requirements. Students who are able to both develop and articulate these skills will be positioned favorably for employment in industry and for postgraduate study (engineering, medicine, law, and business administration). Entering the Program Students must indicate their intent to pursue the BS program at the end of the Autumn Quarter in their second year of study by completing the Intent to Pursue Molecular Engineering questionnaire (available on the IME website). They begin the engineering curriculum in the following Spring Quarter with enrollment in either MENG 26010 Engineering Principles of Conservation or MENG 26020 Engineering Electrodynamics. Both courses require the completion of their stated prerequisites. Students should work with their advisers early in their first year of study to plan for those prerequisites to be completed in a timely manner.

The course takes a genealogical approach to “anthropological theory” by tracking the formation, uptake and entailments of different problem-spaces in anthropology—that is, the distinct complex of questions-and-answers around key themes and problems, which animate the discipline’s various modes of knowledge production. The course takes seriously the interplay of ethnographic inquiry and theory building and of professional practice and public engagement in the development of anthropology as a modern (and postmodern) discipline. While many of the concepts explored here will be recognizable as part of the “bread and butter” of anthropological research, the course is less interested in providing a comprehensive survey of 20th century anthropology than in interrogating the discipline’s signature style of theory building through ethnographic engagements in “the field.” We start from the premise that anthropological theory is a dialectical practice through which realist arguments about the historical world(s)—and the human’s place in it—are honed through empirical encounters and pushback from anthropology’s ethnographic subjects. Ultimately, the course hopes to track how anthropological ways of knowing intervene in the world through the making and stabilizing of particular lived concepts; that is, we ask after theory’s historical formation and durable effects, its social life, as well as afterlives, in the discipline and beyond.", "subsections": [], "condition": "Open", "sectionid": "[43429]", "name": "Develop Social Cultural Thry-2", "location": "TBA", "type": "SEM", "career": "Graduate", "section": "1"}, "GNSE39610": {"daytime": "Tue Thu : 10:30 AM-11:50 AM", "instructor": "Malynne Sternstein", "description": "This course is an intensive reading of Pale Fire by Nabokov.", "subsections": [], "condition": "Open", "sectionid": "[54342]", "name": "Pale Fire", "location": "Stuart Hall 105", "type": "SEM", "career": "Graduate", "section": "1"}, "HIST42701": {"daytime": "Mon : 12:30 PM-03:20 PM", "instructor": "Lucy K Pick", "description": "This course will examine the intersection of religious and secular power and the way these were reflected in and shaped by the gender systems of early medieval Europe.

Second, science has been used to explain aesthetic effects (e.g., Helmholtz’s work on the way painters achieve visual effects or musicians achieve tonal effects).

As a matter of fact, scholars of Antiquity usually refer to Armenia only when it was involved into one of the frequent military crises between East and West. The country had an important strategic position, a vast expanse of territory, and wealthy natural resources. This explains very well the efforts of the Seleucids and of Rome, and of the Iranian dynasties of the Parthians and the Sassanids, to establish a military control and cultural influence over Armenia. Both contacts with the West and the East shaped the complex identity of Armenia - a somewhat mixed identity which is rather difficult to study. Therefore, both Classical and Iranian scholars tend to neglect the role of Armenia, or to diminish its position in the balance of power: the anachronistic cliché of a Greater Armenia as a «buffer state» is still mentioned. Accordingly, the few specialists on pre-Christian Armenia hardly communicate with those other scholars. Therefore, the very marginality of the kingdom of Armenia has not stimulated neither Classical scholars, nor Iranian scholars, to show interest in Armenia as well.

The New Latin American Cinema (NLAC) of the late 1950s-70s generated unprecedented international enthusiasm for Latin American film production. The filmmakers of this loosely designated movement were defining themselves in relation to global realist film traditions like Italian Neorealism and Griersonian documentary, in relation to--mostly failed-- experiments in building Hollywood-style national film industries, and in relation to regional discourses of underdevelopment and mestizaje. Since the late 1990s, a reassessment of the legacy of the NLAC has been taking shape as scholars have begun to interrogate its canonical status in the face of a changed political climate. In the sphere of filmmaking, contemporary Latin American new wave cinemas are also grappling with that legacy-sometimes disavowing it, sometimes appropriating it. We will situate the NLAC in its historical context, survey its formal achievements and political aspirations, assess its legacy, and take stock of the ways and the reasons that it haunts contemporary production.", "subsections": [{"instructor": "Skvirsky", "sectionname": "Section 1S01 [43924] - SCR Open", "daytime": "Thu : 03:30 PM-06:30 PM"}], "condition": "Open", "sectionid": "[43923]", "name": "The New Latin American Cinema and Its Afterlife", "location": "Cobb Hall 311", "type": "SEM", "career": "Undergraduate", "section": "1"}, "ENGL25422": {"daytime": "Mon Wed : 03:00 PM-04:20 PM", "instructor": "Kevin Kimura", "description": "Getting rich quick is practically synonymous with the American Dream.

While The Human Condition will be at the center of the course, the book will be supplemented and framed by other material, including essays on related subjects by Arendt; excerpts from some of the other thinkers with whom Arendt was in conversation; and material by later writers that will help us situate Arendt in the larger contexts of twentieth-century intellectual life, and which will also give us different angles on some of the key issues in Arendt’s book.

For historians, progress and development used to represent the very sense of universal history, a narrative that sneaked into visions of “Western modernity” and “globalization.” But later on, they became a myth to debunk rather than an object of reflection. What has “progress” meant particularly for Latin Americans? What is, for instance, the meaning of “progress” in the Brazilian flag? How did those notions shape the one of “development” since WWII? In political terms, what ideas of “progress” and “development” animated oligarchic, liberal, populist, military, revolutionary, and democratic projects across the region? Because both concepts involve planning and envisioning the outcome of present actions, the history of progress and development is also, in a certain way, a history of the future.

Since the late 1990s, a reassessment of the legacy of the NLAC has been taking shape as scholars have begun to interrogate its canonical status in the face of a changed political climate. In the sphere of filmmaking, contemporary Latin American new wave cinemas are also grappling with that legacy-sometimes disavowing it, sometimes appropriating it.

In 1969, the Supreme Court famously declared that students do not \"shed their constitutional rights when they enter the schoolhouse gate.\" Not surprisingly, though, Supreme Court Justices both before and since have bitterly contested the precise scope of students' constitutional rights in the elementary and secondary school contexts. Some Justices, moreover, have concluded that it is typically unwise for the judiciary to enter the educational realm, lest the Supreme Court turn into a schoolboard for the entire nation.

Rather, scholars today recognize that colonial encounters were complex culture, political, and economic fields of interaction. Africans actively adopted, reworked, and contested colonizers' policies and projects, and Europeans drew heavily from these encounters to form liberal conceptions of self, nation, and society.

The Secret Agent demonstrates, however, much more than its prophetic significance rediscovered after 9/11. Therefore, the course seeks how the novel’s relevance stems in equal measure from Conrad’s interest in a wider political process and his distrust of state power; in particular, the course explores how these forces determine the individual caught in a confining situation. We read The Secret Agent as a political novel, that struggle for solutions defies chaos as well as an imposition of a single ideology or one authorial point of view. Its ambiguities and political antinomies allow for interdisciplinary readings that also present an opportunity to critically overview the established approaches to main Conradian themes. In analyzing the formation of the narrative’s ideology we discuss Conrad’s historical pessimism that demonstrates with sustained irony how capitalism breeds social injustice that, in turn, breeds anarchism.

Students provide legal services to indigent victims of police abuse in federal and state courts. They litigate civil rights cases at each level of the court system from trial through appeals. Some students also represent children and adults in related juvenile or criminal defense matters. Students take primary responsibility for all aspects of the litigation, including client counseling, fact investigation, case strategy, witness interviews, legal research, pleadings and legal memoranda, discovery, depositions, motion practice, evidentiary hearings, trials, and appeals. A significant amount of legal writing is expected. Students work in teams on cases or projects, and meet with the instructor on at minimum a weekly basis. Students also take primary responsibility for the Clinic’s policy and public education work. PAP teaches students to apply and critically examine legal theory in the context of representation of people in need. It teaches students to analyze how and why individual cases of abuse occur and to connect them to systemic problems, often leading to “public impact” litigation and other strategies for policy reform.

To explore this term this class will draw largely on a tradition of commentary on the German word Das Unheimliche, usually translated as uncanny, that can be traced among Ernst Jentsch, Sigmund Freud, and Martin Heidegger and its relevance to film studies. Freud and his disciple Otto Rank before 1920 related the uncanny to the cinema, and cinema’s ability to evoke the uncanny has been frequently observed. On the one hand, the cinema’s ability to portray uncanny events (as in Rank and Freud’s invocation of the 1913 film the Student in Prague) appears generically in films of fantasy or horror. In addition, some theorists have felt that film as a medium could be best approached via the uncanny. In this class, we will read a series of the key texts and try to survey the terrain of the concept of the uncanny.

Through a close study of key texts in this tradition, we will investigate how Islam has remained a vital source of principles and doctrines for a diverse array of political thinkers and movements over the course of the past two centuries. Developments in Islamic thought will be considered in the context of global trends, from the rise of liberalism, nationalism, and socialism to the liberation movements of the twentieth century and the confusion sewn by humanitarian crises of an unprecedented scale. Amidst these dramatic shifts in the geopolitical landscape, how have Muslim thinkers sought to ground their demands for dignity, autonomy, justice, and recognition? What do such claims have to do with the pursuit of personal and collective piety, on the one hand, and spiritual transcendence, on the other? Rather than framing Muslim political thinkers as reacting to global modernity, we understand them as key actors in shaping it, and our study of their writings will be oriented toward achieving a better understanding of the modern era as a whole. Our primary readings will take us from Istanbul, London, and the Nile Delta to Chicago, Tehran, and beyond, while our secondary texts will offer historical background and theoretical and theological context for the thinkers we focus on. The course aims to equip students to explore the Islamic tradition of political thought on their own. All required readings will be made available in English; the ability to read texts in their original languages of authorship (Arabic, Persian, Turkish, Urdu, French, etc.) is useful but not necessary.

Indeed, it is guaranteed in the very etymology of the French and German words “mode” and “modernité”. Yet, on closer inspection, there is a blind spot in this relation in that fashion seems rather to be the Other of modernity than modernity itself, an Oriental colony in the heart of the West. The modern discourse of fashion testifies to the ambivalences and paradoxes in this relationship. From the beginning of the modern world until now, it is strangely split: there is fashion and fashion. Properly speaking, men’s fashion is not really fashionable. The perfectly functional suit without superfluous adornment is, in its world-wide constancy through the centuries, almost invariably classical. Its staggering universal success is due to the fact that it is the ideal modern dress: beautiful, because functional. Women’s fashion, on the contrary, is a remnant of the old, effeminate aristocracy – a frivolous frill, an all-in-all dysfunctional ornament, badly in need of thorough modernization. The „new woman“ is born in agonizing pain and perpetual fallbacks: while Chanel almost lead us toward a functional feminine form, Dior’s new look was, from this perspective, a setback: it brought back the unhealthy, restrictive corset and offered a slap in the face to the modern aesthetic dogma of „form follows function“. Fashion therefore seems to be the locus of a strange intimation of the political set against the common politics of modernity. By reading texts form Friedrich Nietzsche to Adolf Loos and Thorstein Veblen, Rousseau to Baudelaire, from Gautier, Zola and Apollinaire to Simone de Beauvoir and Pierre Bourdieu, the course will center around this blind spot between fashion and modernity and the new gendering of fashion in the bourgeois, post-feudal era.", "subsections": [], "condition": "Open", "sectionid": "[53928]", "name": "Fashion and Modernity", "location": "Classics Building 313", "type": "SEM", "career": "Graduate", "section": "1"}, "ECON60600": {"daytime": "Tue : 12:00 PM-01:20 PM", "instructor": "Fernando Alvarez, Robert Shimer, Nancy L Stokey", "description": "", "subsections": [], "condition": "Open", "sectionid": "[43822]", "name": "Working Group: Capital Theory", "location": "Saieh Hall for Economics 112", "type": "SEM", "career": "Graduate", "section": "1"}, "ANTH24003": {"daytime": "Mon Wed : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM", "instructor": "Pierre Sean Brotherton", "description": "The third quarter considers the processes and consequences of decolonization both in the newly independent nations and the former colonial powers.

Therefore, the course seeks how the novel’s relevance stems in equal measure from Conrad’s interest in a wider political process and his distrust of state power; in particular, the course explores how these forces determine the individual caught in a confining situation. We read The Secret Agent as a political novel, that struggle for solutions defies chaos as well as an imposition of a single ideology or one authorial point of view. Its ambiguities and political antinomies allow for interdisciplinary readings that also present an opportunity to critically overview the established approaches to main Conradian themes. In analyzing the formation of the narrative’s ideology we discuss Conrad’s historical pessimism that demonstrates with sustained irony how capitalism breeds social injustice that, in turn, breeds anarchism.

Among the most exciting and novel findings and theories, evolutionary biologists and comparative psychologists have shown that moral cognition has evolved to facilitate cooperation and smooth social interactions, and that certain components of morality are present in non-human animals. Developmental psychologists came up with ingenious paradigms, demonstrating that the elements that underpin morality are in place much earlier than we thought, and clearly in place before children turn two. Social neuroscientists have begun to map brain circuits implicated in moral decision-making and identify the contribution of neuropetides to moral sensitivity. Changes in the balance of brain chemistry, or in connectivity between regions can cause changes in moral behavior. The lesson from all this new knowledge is clear: human moral behavior cannot be separated from human biology, its development, and past evolutionary history. As our understanding of the human brain improves, society at large, and justice and the law in particular, are and will be increasingly challenged. Discoveries in neuroscience will soon impact our legal system in ways that hopefully lead to a more cost-effective, humane and flexible system than we have today.

Contemporary critics often consider this novel the archetypal fictional work about terrorism, as it is based on the bomb attack that occurred in Greenwich in 1888. The Secret Agent demonstrates, however, much more than its prophetic significance rediscovered after 9/11. Therefore, the course seeks how the novel’s relevance stems in equal measure from Conrad’s interest in a wider political process and his distrust of state power; in particular, the course explores how these forces determine the individual caught in a confining situation. We read The Secret Agent as a political novel, that struggle for solutions defies chaos as well as an imposition of a single ideology or one authorial point of view. Its ambiguities and political antinomies allow for interdisciplinary readings that also present an opportunity to critically overview the established approaches to main Conradian themes. In analyzing the formation of the narrative’s ideology we discuss Conrad’s historical pessimism that demonstrates with sustained irony how capitalism breeds social injustice that, in turn, breeds anarchism. The class also focuses on how the novel exposes duplicity in staging surveillance, terrorism, as well as adjacent forms of violence or sacrifice.

The course objective is to show that while colonialism was brutal and oppressive, it was by no means a unidirectional process of domination in which Europeans plundered the African continent and enforced a wholesale adoption of European culture. Rather, scholars today recognize that colonial encounters were complex culture, political, and economic fields of interaction. Africans actively adopted, reworked, and contested colonizers' policies and projects, and Europeans drew heavily from these encounters to form liberal conceptions of self, nation, and society. Over the course of the quarter, students will learn about forms of personhood, political economy, and everyday life in the twentieth century. Course themes will include social reproduction, kinship practices, medicine, domesticity, and development.

We will combine the theoretical and the practical. We will think creatively and philosophically about what could be, and work concretely on how to build it. Government is, everywhere, an industry in serious trouble. Its consumers are disenchanted and looking for alternatives, its products are failing the tests of quality and innovation, and its cost structure is too high. If governments were private firms, they’d be facing the dual prospects of either a takeover to “rescue” them or death in the competitive marketplace as their customer base migrates to newer alternatives. And, in fact, governments today face precisely those challenges. The idea behind this course is to address the government biz as exactly that: a mismanaged industry, business entity, or brand. We will study the history of the modern state and theories of how it will evolve in coming decades. We will consider what this means for the institution of government and what exactly “government” is. And we will look at what this means for the potential of private-sector, non-profit, non-governmental and trans-governmental entities to compete with the nation-state and take over its functions – and the possibilities that government can compete back and perhaps expand its own “business” line. But the course is intended to produce not just deep-thinking and new theories, but also concrete business plans. Students will be expected to identify either a new business idea or product line for a government entity to launch or a current government function that a for-profit or non-profit business can undertake to compete successfully with the public sector – and then develop a detailed business plan. This will require analyzing market opportunities, carrying out financial projections, understanding the realities of program delivery, and crafting a winning message for investors and/or voters.

China is growing stronger and more influential in every domain worldwide and likely to increasingly threaten the status quo. The U.S., meanwhile, finds itself in the grips of a populist movement led by President Trump, who is openly critical of China. The relationship, which was already mistrustful, has grown even more fragile and anxious in recent weeks with talk of tariffs, Taiwan, and the South China Sea. The accusations and threats suggest that we are likely to witness greater turbulence than what we have experienced in the past forty years. The reality is that both nations need each other; both have significant economic, political, and security interests at stake. If the two nations learn how to collaborate, they could conceivably solve the world’s greatest problems. Alternatively, if they elect to contest each other at every turn, the result will be global instability and crisis. Clearly, a new framework for cooperation and collaboration is needed – quite possibly “a new deal,” in the language of President Trump. What will constitute such a deal? How will it work? How likely is a deal, and, if one does occur, will it survive the volatility of an America First foreign policy? This seminar will advocate that the two nations develop a new, fifty-year treaty in the form of a strategic cooperation agreement. We will define the rationale and the case for action, draft major components of the proposed treaty, outline the pathway required for adoption, and transmit our end-product to foreign policy authorities in Washington and Beijing.

We then proceed to unpack the structural role of the different elements of that narrative. With the help of Žižek’s theory of the subject as constituted by trauma, we think about the national fixation on the trauma of loss, and the role of trauma in the formation of national consciousness. Specific theme inquiries involve the figure of the Janissary as self and other, brotherhood and fratricide, and the writing of the national trauma on the individual physical body. Special attention is given to the general aesthetic of victimhood, the casting of the victimized national self as the object of the “other’s perverse desire.” With the help of Freud, Žižek, and Kant we consider the transformation of national victimhood into the sublimity of the national self. The main primary texts include Petar Njegoš’ Mountain Wreath (Serbia and Montenegro), Ismail Kadare’s The Castle (Albania), Anton Donchev’s Time of Parting (Bulgaria).", "subsections": [], "condition": "Open", "sectionid": "[42374]", "name": "The Burden of History: The Nation and Its Lost Paradise", "location": "Foster Hall 408", "type": "LEC", "career": "Undergraduate", "section": "1"}, "CHEM40000": {"daytime": "TBA", "instructor": "Vera Dragisich", "description": "", "subsections": [], "condition": "Open", "sectionid": "[40978]", "name": "Rsch: Related Depts/Institutes", "location": "TBA", "type": "RSC", "career": "Graduate", "section": "1"}, "CMSC38000": {"daytime": "Tue Thu : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM", "instructor": "Denis Hirschfeldt", "description": "We investigate the computability and relative computability of functions and sets.

It is a comprehensive treatment regimen focusing on the transformation of behavior responses to intrapersonal, interpersonal and environmental factors contributing to problems related to impulsivity, emotional lability, cognitive dysregulation and interpersonal chaos. Due to its success treating various psychiatric populations, DBT is now considered effective with persons who engage in any behavior where the function of the behavior is to avoid or escape aversive thoughts and/or emotions. DBT was one of the first cognitive behavior therapies to integrate mindfulness, acceptance and willingness into treatment regimens that traditionally focus on change and control. It is therefore considered a pioneering therapy in what is now called the \"third wave\" in behaviorism. This class is intended to provide students with advanced training in the principles and practice of DBT. To that end, via lecture, experiential exercises, roleplay and a self-change project, participants will be exposed to the four components of DBT: Skills Training, Individual Therapy, Telephone Consultation and the Consultation Group. However, a basic tenet of DBT is that therapists should not expect their clients to engage in behaviors and activities they are unwilling to do. Therefore, emphasis in this class will be place on experiential knowledge. Therefore, interested participants will be expected to make a basic set of commitments that expose them to many of the emotional reactions experienced by their future clients. In addition to a self-change project, participants will commit to complete a diary card and practice mindfulness on a daily basis.

Since the late 1990s, a reassessment of the legacy of the NLAC has been taking shape as scholars have begun to interrogate its canonical status in the face of a changed political climate. In the sphere of filmmaking, contemporary Latin American new wave cinemas are also grappling with that legacy-sometimes disavowing it, sometimes appropriating it.

These memos help the full Court determine which cases to hear on the merits; (2) review merits briefs and write a bench memo to assist your Justice at oral argument and at Conference (where the Justices meet to resolve argued matters); (3) draft a judicial opinion assigned to your Justice (which may well entail a judgment or legal reasoning the clerk does not agree with); and (4) lead class discussion and debate for the cert-pool and merits cases for which the clerk took primary responsibility. Over the course of the seminar, each clerk will write three cert-pool memos, one bench memo, and one opinion. The seminar is aimed at students who have or seek a state or federal clerkship and those with a possible interest in clerking for a U.S. Supreme Court Justice. A firm background in constitutional law is strongly recommended, and your open-minded Justice seeks applicants with a wide array of political and jurisprudential perspectives.

Specific theme inquiries involve the figure of the Janissary as self and other, brotherhood and fratricide, and the writing of the national trauma on the individual physical body. Special attention is given to the general aesthetic of victimhood, the casting of the victimized national self as the object of the “other’s perverse desire.” With the help of Freud, Žižek, and Kant we consider the transformation of national victimhood into the sublimity of the national self.

During the so-called Fourth Crusade, the Sack of Constantinople has led to large-scale pillaging of the Byzantine capital and the transfer to Venice of countless Byzantine artifacts, among them are liturgical items, reliquaries, icons, and architectural spoils. How were these artifacts employed in the Venetian Lagoon for religious and political ends after being disassociated from their original contexts? What transformations did they experience with regard to usage and appearance? What kinds of new ceremonies, both religious and secular, did they inspire? What was their impact on artistic creativity and religious life in their new environment? How were they perceived intellectually, and what kinds of narratives evolved around them in Venice over the centuries? These are some of the key questions to guide our research.

Third, aesthetic means have been used to convey scientific conceptions (e.g., through illustrations in scientific volumes or through aesthetically affective and effective writing). Finally, philosophers have stepped back to consider the relationship between scientific knowing and aesthetic comprehension (e.g., Kant, Bas van Fraassen); much of the discussion of this latter will focus on the relation between images and what they represent.

The country had an important strategic position, a vast expanse of territory, and wealthy natural resources. This explains very well the efforts of the Seleucids and of Rome, and of the Iranian dynasties of the Parthians and the Sassanids, to establish a military control and cultural influence over Armenia. Both contacts with the West and the East shaped the complex identity of Armenia - a somewhat mixed identity which is rather difficult to study. Therefore, both Classical and Iranian scholars tend to neglect the role of Armenia, or to diminish its position in the balance of power: the anachronistic cliché of a Greater Armenia as a «buffer state» is still mentioned. Accordingly, the few specialists on pre-Christian Armenia hardly communicate with those other scholars. Therefore, the very marginality of the kingdom of Armenia has not stimulated neither Classical scholars, nor Iranian scholars, to show interest in Armenia as well.

Methods include, but are not limited to, inference for means and proportions for one- and two-sample problems, two-way tables, correlation, and simple linear regression. Graphical and numerical data description are used for exploration, communication of results, and comparing mathematical consequences of probability models and data. Mathematics employed is to the level of single-variable differential and integral calculus and sequences and series.

Since the late 1990s, a reassessment of the legacy of the NLAC has been taking shape as scholars have begun to interrogate its canonical status in the face of a changed political climate. In the sphere of filmmaking, contemporary Latin American new wave cinemas are also grappling with that legacy-sometimes disavowing it, sometimes appropriating it.

Most sessions are led by visiting speakers, from either outside institutions or our own faculty, who circulate their papers in advance. The session consists of a brief introduction by the speaker, followed by initial questioning by the two faculty coordinators, followed by general discussion, in which students are given priority. The topic for 2016-17 will expose students to cutting-edge work in general jurisprudence, that part of philosophy of law concerned with the central questions about the nature of law, the relationship between law and morality, and the nature of legal reasoning. We will be particularly interested in the way in which work in philosophy of language, metaethics, metaphysics, and other cognate fields of philosophy has influenced recent scholarly debates that have arisen in the wake of H.L.A. Hart’s seminal The Concept of Law (1961). Please see www.law.uchicago.edu/workshops/lawandphilosophy for additional information concerning each session.

We will apply the concepts and techniques of corporate finance to actual situations. The course is roughly divided into three sections: (1) financing decisions; (2) investment decisions; (3) entrepreneurial finance; and (4) private equity finance. In addition to analyzing the specific financing problems or issues, we will consider how those issues relate to the strategic objectives of the firm. It will be important to examine the \"big picture\" assumptions that are used in the numerical calculations. This course also places a strong emphasis on presentation and discussion skills. It will be important to explain your positions or arguments to each other and to try to argue for the implementation of your recommendations. COURSE PROCEDURES For each class meeting, I will assign study questions concerning one or two case studies. For most of the class period, we will consider the questions and the material in the cases. This includes the first meeting. You are allowed and encouraged, but not required to meet in groups outside of class to discuss and analyze the cases. Each group will submit a two-page memorandum of analysis and recommendations at the beginning of each case discussion. If you are working in a group, I will accept one memorandum from the group and count it for all students in the group. If you choose to do this, the group can include up to 3 students. Each memorandum should be typed and double-spaced. Write these as if you were writing a recommendation to the CEO or major decision maker in the case. The two page limit is for text only. You may attach as many numerical calculations as you wish. Memoranda will not be accepted after the class has met. A memorandum will be given credit if it is handed in and no credit if it is not. Initially, therefore, I will not grade them. However, I will use the memoranda to determine final grades for those students who are on the border of two grades. You should prepare a memorandum for UST, the first class. The readings and articles that I have assigned and will hand out are largely non-technical in nature and summarize the findings of academic research in corporate finance in the recent past. These articles are meant to be background material that will help you analyze the cases. They should not necessarily be cited in the case discussion. You should argue as if you were in a corporate boardroom rather than in a doctoral seminar. The process of arriving at the answer is as important as getting the answer. Because of the nature of this course (and its grading criteria), it is extremely important that you attend every class, arrive on time and be prepared to participate. To help me out, you should bring your name cards to each class. I may not remember who said what without those cards. In the past, students have asked me to hand out my case analysis after the class has discussed the case. I will not do this, because there are usually no absolute right answers. The best cases are deliberately written to be ambiguous. While there are no right answers, there are good arguments and bad arguments. This course is designed to help you learn to distinguish between sensible and senseless arguments. Handing out my analyses would reduce the ambiguity in the cases and partially defeat the purpose of doing cases. If you are uncomfortable with ambiguity, this class may not be for you.

This course will examine the nature of wisdom—how it has been defined, how its meaning has changed, and what its essential components might be. We will examine how current psychological theories conceptualize wisdom and consider whether, and how, wisdom can be studied scientifically; that is, can wisdom be measured and experimentally manipulated to illuminate its underlying mechanisms and understand its functions?

We then proceed to unpack the structural role of the different elements of that narrative. With the help of Žižek’s theory of the subject as constituted by trauma, we think about the national fixation on the trauma of loss, and the role of trauma in the formation of national consciousness. Specific theme inquiries involve the figure of the Janissary as self and other, brotherhood and fratricide, and the writing of the national trauma on the individual physical body. Special attention is given to the general aesthetic of victimhood, the casting of the victimized national self as the object of the “other’s perverse desire.” With the help of Freud, Žižek, and Kant we consider the transformation of national victimhood into the sublimity of the national self.

This course will examine this three-hundred-year history by investigating the following essential questions: (1) How did a collection of diverse kingdoms manage to create a global empire? (2) What specific factors can explain the Spanish decline of the seventeenth century? (3) Was the Spanish Empire doomed to fail from the very beginning? (4) Why did many colonial subjects remain loyal to Spain after the Conquest and especially after a century of decline? (5) Why did the empire collapse only after 1808? In our exploration of these questions, we will pay particular attention to Spain's ambitious and pioneering, if also destructive, involvement with conquest, colonial exploitation, chattel slavery, racial domination, and a mission to \"civilize\" the world.

After taking this course, you should improve your ability to determine a firm's accounting policy for a particular type of transaction and to determine how that policy choice affects its primary financial statements. You will also learn how to question whether these effects fairly reflect the underlying economics of the firm's transactions. Asking these questions involves an interplay between accounting, economics, finance, law and business strategy. You should therefore greatly improve your ability to use an accounting report as part of an overall assessment of the firm's strategy and the potential rewards and risks of dealing with the firm. The teaching approach will be a roughly equal combination of lecture time and demanding case applications of the lecture material that will involve group case assignments that will form the basis for in-class discussion of the cases. The technical knowledge acquired from the lecture material is applied to cases where the main goal is to examine how the reported financial statements would differ if the firm had used different accounting policies. The focus is on modifying the reported financial statements in order to obtain the cleanest possible inputs for use in such applications as equity valuation, transaction structuring and credit analysis. The topics to be discussed are likely to include the accounting for, and interpretation of: revenue recognition, intercorporate investments, organizational structures (e.g., franchising), debt, and leases. Intensive group hand-in cases will be used to illustrate how the flexibility in financial reporting can reflect both the economics of the firm and the incentives of the managers creating the financial statements. It is REQUIRED that students registering for this course have prior exposure to accounting course work, at least at the level of Fundamentals of Accounting for Attorneys (LAWS 79112 or 53260), but with a strong preference for the stronger background knowledge provided by the Booth course Financial Accounting (B30000).", "subsections": [], "condition": "List", "sectionid": "[40571]", "name": "Accounting and Financial Analysis", "location": "Laird Bell Quadrangle E", "type": "CRS", "career": "Law School", "section": "01"}, "EALC24706": {"daytime": "Tue Thu : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM", "instructor": "Susan Burns", "description": "This course will explore the cultural and cultural history of Edo/Tokyo from its origins in the early seventeenth century through circa 1945.

Since the late 1990s, a reassessment of the legacy of the NLAC has been taking shape as scholars have begun to interrogate its canonical status in the face of a changed political climate. In the sphere of filmmaking, contemporary Latin American new wave cinemas are also grappling with that legacy-sometimes disavowing it, sometimes appropriating it.

At the same time, we will question whether Freud’s reflections on the psychopathologies of modern culture can in fact help to explain specific structural and social transformations in the 19th century public sphere, like the construction of modern sewer systems, the legal regulation of sexual acts, or the development of obscenity law. Finally, we will interrogate how the unconscious operates as a site of theoretical interest within Marxist and postcolonial critiques of modern imperialism. Our readings of 19th century novels will be complemented by extensive readings in psychoanalytic theory (Freud, Klein, Lacan, Winnicott) and pre-pscyhoanalytic psychiatry (e.g. Esquirol, Tuke, Krafft-Ebing, Charcot, Cotard), as well as relevant works by theorists elaborating and questioning psychoanalytic insights, including George Batailles, Michel Foucault, Jacques Rancière, Frederic Jameson, Edward Said, Kaja Silverman, Lauren Berlant, Eve Kosofsky Sed", "subsections": [], "condition": "Open", "sectionid": "[41087]", "name": "The Victorian Unconscious", "location": "Rosenwald Hall 405", "type": "SEM", "career": "Graduate", "section": "1"}, "REES29013": {"daytime": "Mon Wed : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM", "instructor": "Angelina Ilieva", "description": "How and why do national identities provoke the deep emotional attachments that they do?

We then proceed to unpack the structural role of the different elements of that narrative. With the help of Žižek’s theory of the subject as constituted by trauma, we think about the national fixation on the trauma of loss, and the role of trauma in the formation of national consciousness. Specific theme inquiries involve the figure of the Janissary as self and other, brotherhood and fratricide, and the writing of the national trauma on the individual physical body. Special attention is given to the general aesthetic of victimhood, the casting of the victimized national self as the object of the “other’s perverse desire.” With the help of Freud, Žižek, and Kant we consider the transformation of national victimhood into the sublimity of the national self.

In investigating the significance of play to human life, we will also consider the ethics and aesthetics of playing. (3) How can thinking about play cast light on other human activities?

In this course we try to understand these emotional attachments by examining the narrative of loss and redemption through which most nations in the Balkans retell their Ottoman past. We begin by considering the mythic temporality of the Romantic national narrative while focusing on specific national literary texts where the national past is retold through the formula of original wholeness, foreign invasion, Passion, and Salvation. We then proceed to unpack the structural role of the different elements of that narrative. With the help of Žižek’s theory of the subject as constituted by trauma, we think about the national fixation on the trauma of loss, and the role of trauma in the formation of national consciousness. Specific theme inquiries involve the figure of the Janissary as self and other, brotherhood and fratricide, and the writing of the national trauma on the individual physical body. Special attention is given to the general aesthetic of victimhood, the casting of the victimized national self as the object of the “other’s perverse desire.” With the help of Freud, Žižek, and Kant we consider the transformation of national victimhood into the sublimity of the national self.

Yet we often fail to see the extent to which the questions which we ask of all of these diverse sources are conditioned by Christian rhetoric about pagan worship.

We then proceed to unpack the structural role of the different elements of that narrative. With the help of Žižek’s theory of the subject as constituted by trauma, we think about the national fixation on the trauma of loss, and the role of trauma in the formation of national consciousness. Specific theme inquiries involve the figure of the Janissary as self and other, brotherhood and fratricide, and the writing of the national trauma on the individual physical body. Special attention is given to the general aesthetic of victimhood, the casting of the victimized national self as the object of the “other’s perverse desire.” With the help of Freud, Žižek, and Kant we consider the transformation of national victimhood into the sublimity of the national self.

We also examine the relational model and functional dependencies and their application to the methods for improving database design: normal forms and normalization. After design and modeling, students will learn the universal language of relational databases: SQL (Structured Query Language). We start by introducing relational algebra -- the theoretical foundation of SQL. Then we examine in detail the two aspects of SQL: data definition language (DDL) and the data manipulation language (DML).

Students who have completed fifty percent of the credits needed for graduation may be licensed to appear, under the supervision of the clinical teacher, in state and federal trial and appellate courts pursuant to court rules and practices. Students engaged in legislative advocacy may research and draft legislation and supporting materials, devise and implement strategies to obtain the enactment or defeat of legislation, negotiate with representatives of various interest groups, and testify in legislative hearings. In addition to discrete advocacy skills such as cross-examination, discovery planning, and legislative drafting, the course aims to provide students with an understanding of the relationships between individual advocacy tasks and the ultimate goals of clients, between litigation and legislative advocacy, and between advocacy on behalf of individual clients and advocacy for systemic change. Prior or contemporaneous enrollment in Law and the Mental Health System is encouraged, but not required, for all students.

Rather, scholars today recognize that colonial encounters were complex culture, political, and economic fields of interaction. Africans actively adopted, reworked, and contested colonizers' policies and projects, and Europeans drew heavily from these encounters to form liberal conceptions of self, nation, and society.

In this course we try to understand these emotional attachments by examining the narrative of loss and redemption through which most nations in the Balkans retell their Ottoman past. We begin by considering the mythic temporality of the Romantic national narrative while focusing on specific national literary texts where the national past is retold through the formula of original wholeness, foreign invasion, Passion, and Salvation. We then proceed to unpack the structural role of the different elements of that narrative. With the help of Žižek’s theory of the subject as constituted by trauma, we think about the national fixation on the trauma of loss, and the role of trauma in the formation of national consciousness. Specific theme inquiries involve the figure of the Janissary as self and other, brotherhood and fratricide, and the writing of the national trauma on the individual physical body. Special attention is given to the general aesthetic of victimhood, the casting of the victimized national self as the object of the “other’s perverse desire.” With the help of Freud, Žižek, and Kant we consider the transformation of national victimhood into the sublimity of the national self.

The main aim of this course will be to arrive at a reading of it that (1) situates it in the context of earlier philosophers’ writings about selves, memory, and consciousness, (2) is informed by an understanding of Locke’s own views concerning substance, consciousness, and memory, among other things, (3) carefully considers objections that later writers—most famously Butler and Reid—made to Locke’s theory.

ACT assists clients in differentiating between those aspects of life where the only viable stance is that of acceptance and willingness and those where action is required given their desire to live meaningfully. In doing so, clients fundamentally shift from having their lives about their past and their problems to a life about their values and their future. This class is intended to provide students with a comprehensive overview of and practice with the principles of ACT. To that end, via lecture, experiential exercises, role-play and a self-change project, participants will be presented with the underlying theory (Relation Frame Theory) and assumptions of ACT, an ACT conceptualization of human suffering, a model of psychological rigidity and flexibility and the six basic clinical processes. ACT emphasizes experiential knowledge over intellectual ascent.

Most of the course examines the strategies for evaluating the impact that government policies have on alternative outcomes. The key question here is what would have been the outcome had individuals, neighborhoods, state, etc., not been exposed to the policy. The impact of the policy is the difference between the actual outcome and this counterfactual outcome.

Literatures across the disciplines are full of living bodies and concrete experiences, object biographies, ‘theories of things,’ a return to ‘matter,’ ‘new’ materialisms spun out of ‘old’ ones… While generative, materiality’s ubiquity also betrays a gap, an ambiguity, an absence. For what materiality is exactly remains unsure. Some seem to use it as a descriptive shorthand for the material world. Others as an analytic tending to the materialness of existence. Or as a discourse on it. For others still, it denotes the tangible effects of actions, practice, signs, and thought. Or a framework for unpacking the relationships mediating between people and things… Conjurations abound, yet seldom escape a certain circularity (“materiality studies… materiality?”). The concept has been used to frame a near infinite horizon of topics, from artefacts, of course, to cosmology, faith, finance, and absence, encompassing phenomena both enduring and ephemeral, both there and not-there. In taking on so much, has materiality outlasted its usefulness? What analytic work did it perform in the first place? With these considerations as background, through classic and recent literatures, this seminar will examine the relevance of ‘materiality’ (epistemologically, conceptually, methodologically) to anthropologies of the contemporary world, at a time when the ontologies of old are dissolving into a bubbling landscape of mixtures, hybridities, and post-humanities, which forces us to rethink basic questions of identity, agency, ethics and politics.", "subsections": [], "condition": "Closed", "sectionid": "[43532]", "name": "Materiality", "location": "TBA", "type": "SEM", "career": "Graduate", "section": "1"}, "BUSN33471": {"daytime": "Thu : 06:00 PM-09:00 PM", "instructor": "Brian Barry", "description": "Course Search", "subsections": [], "condition": "Open", "sectionid": "[41896]", "name": "Business, Politics, and Ethics", "location": "Gleacher Center 404", "type": "LEC", "career": "Chicago Booth School", "section": "81"}, "KORE21400": {"daytime": "Tue Thu : 12:00 PM-01:20 PM", "instructor": "Won Na", "description": "", "subsections": [], "condition": "Open", "sectionid": "[54201]", "name": "Business Korean", "location": "Harper Mem Library 102", "type": "LEC", "career": "Undergraduate", "section": "1"}, "MSBI30200": {"daytime": "Fri : 09:00 AM-05:00 PM", "instructor": "David McClintock, Samuel Volchenboum", "description": "MScBMI students need to have a good understanding of how big clinical settings work.
