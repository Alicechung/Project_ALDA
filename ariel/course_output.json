In the class actions, the Clinic represents groups of employees in employment and civil rights actions in federal court. Additionally, in its individual cases and law reform/impact cases, the Clinic seeks to improve the procedures and remedies available to victims of employment discrimination so that employees have a fair opportunity to present their claims in a reasonably expeditious way. To accomplish this goal, the Clinic is active in the legislative arena and participates with other civil rights groups in efforts to amend and improve state and federal laws. It is suggested, but not required, that all students in the Employment Law Clinic take the Employment Discrimination Law seminar. It is recommended that third-year students take, prior to their third year, either the Intensive Trial Practice Workshop or some other trial practice course.

We will read Gombrowicz’s novels, lectures on philosophy and some of his autobiographical writings to seek answers to our overarching question: what makes this author a philosopher?", "sectionid": "[42356]", "section": "1", "location": "Foster Hall 408", "coursenumber": "FNDL26903", "career": "Undergraduate", "instructor": "Bozena Shallcross", "condition": "Open", "daytime": "Tue Thu : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM"}, "PEDS3060040[40083]": {"subsections": [], "name": "Pediatric Infectious Disease", "type": "CLE", "description": "", "sectionid": "[40083]", "section": "40", "location": "Arranged ARR", "coursenumber": "PEDS30600", "career": "Pritzker School of Medicine", "instructor": "Staff", "condition": "Open", "daytime": "Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri : 08:00 AM-06:00 PM"}, "BUSN3720181[41957]": {"subsections": [], "name": "Lab in Developing New Products and Services", "type": "LEC", "description": "Course Search", "sectionid": "[41957]", "section": "81", "location": "Gleacher Center 408", "coursenumber": "BUSN37201", "career": "Chicago Booth School", "instructor": "Craig Terrill", "condition": "Open", "daytime": "Fri : 06:00 PM-09:00 PM"}, "LAWS4030101[40592]": {"subsections": [], "name": "Constitutional Law III: Equal Protection and Substantive Due Process", "type": "CRS", "description": "(BID, CORE) This course considers the history, theory, and contemporary law of the post-Civil War Amendments to the Constitution, particularly the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.

The Chinese materials, all readings of which will be in translation, range from commemorative inscriptions cast in bronze sacral vessels and descriptions of legal practices in received texts, to actual statutes and case records, philosophical texts and legal debates. The medium, discovery/transmission, and authorship of each document will be given due consideration for the effect they may have on our understanding of the contemporary legal context from which the text derives. The course culminates with student presentations on the material of their choice. Preparation for presentations will be conducted in consult with the instructor. Students are encouraged to draw from their study of other legal systems and/or systems of legal thought (both modern and pre-modern) in their discussion of the ancient Chinese material.

Increasingly, regulatory rules are becoming more complex and authorities are becoming more unforgiving, with stepped up efforts to secure criminal and civil penalties against companies, their executives, lawyers and auditors. For companies, such liability can at best result in plummeting share prices, and at worst the shutting down of an enterprise. For individuals, they can result in incarceration, fines, penalties and removal from the business. While many of the principles apply to all industries, the seminar will explore the regulatory and legal foundations for these programs primarily through the lens of the financial services sector, which includes banks, brokerage firms, investment companies and investment advisers. We will also explore how the design and execution of these programs can avoid or limit potential liabilities from regulatory and criminal authorities. From the perspective of a corporate executive, board member or counsel, students will develop the ability to understand the fundamentals of regulatory regimes overseeing these businesses, as well as strategies for successfully engaging the regulators. Students will consider the steps a firm should take to mitigate regulatory and reputation risk, including the importance of an effective corporate ethics program, as well as how, in the process, a firm can enhance its brand, meet the expectations of its board of directors and create value for its shareholders.", "sectionid": "[40589]", "section": "01", "location": "Laird Bell Quadrangle E", "coursenumber": "LAWS53317", "career": "Law School", "instructor": "Charles Senatore", "condition": "List", "daytime": "Mon : 04:00 PM-06:00 PM"}, "MENG242001[42406]": {"subsections": [{"sectionname": "Section 1D01 [42407] - DIS Open", "instructor": "Staff", "daytime": "Mon : 08:30 AM-09:20 AM"}], "name": "Selec Tpcs Molec Engineering: Molecular/Materials Modelling II", "type": "LEC", "description": "This course provides a continuation of the topics covered in Molecular Modelling I.

Whose will do these forms represent (who is the “us” in Rivera’s “our will”)? What representational strategies enable this exteriorization and dramatize its limitations? Why was the novel so often singled out, and why did some feminist writers prefer instead a collection of letters, poems, journal entries, and personal essays?

Students will develop their research and writing skills by drafting an appellate brief based on a factual scenario that mirrors real life cases encountered in day-to-day legal practice. During the brief-writing process, students will be introduced to the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure and the basic rules of professional conduct that govern formal court submissions. After completing the brief, students will focus on developing their presentation skills and attend a guest lecture on oral advocacy taught by a federal judge. At this stage, students will begin the transactional module and attend specially-designed classes taught by members of the Law School’s clinical faculty, which will focus on a range of key competencies, including contract-drafting and negotiation strategy, among other areas. The class culminates in the formal Bigelow Moot Court, in which students argue before a three-judge panel of law professors and distinguished attorneys who will provide students with (1) an opportunity for self-assessment, and (2) individualized feedback on their oral advocacy. Each of the experiential components of the Lawyering class – brief writing, oral advocacy, and transactional work – builds upon the competencies that students have developed throughout the first-year legal writing program and provides them with an introduction to basic lawyering skills.", "sectionid": "[58456]", "section": "05", "location": "Laird Bell Quadrangle III", "coursenumber": "LAWS30712", "career": "Law School", "instructor": "Diego Zambrano", "condition": "Open", "daytime": "Tue Fri : 09:10 AM-10:15 AM"}, "DVSC4990015[57312]": {"subsections": [], "name": "Exam Preparation: Divinity", "type": "IND", "description": "Open only to Ph.D. students in quarter of qualifying exams.

Therefore, the course seeks how the novel’s relevance stems in equal measure from Conrad’s interest in a wider political process and his distrust of state power; in particular, the course explores how these forces determine the individual caught in a confining situation. We read The Secret Agent as a political novel, that struggle for solutions defies chaos as well as an imposition of a single ideology or one authorial point of view. Its ambiguities and political antinomies allow for interdisciplinary readings that also present an opportunity to critically overview the established approaches to main Conradian themes. In analyzing the formation of the narrative’s ideology we discuss Conrad’s historical pessimism that demonstrates with sustained irony how capitalism breeds social injustice that, in turn, breeds anarchism.

On the other, the treatment of these recurring themes according to established “rules” of the mystery genre has helped promote the creation of a reading public that shares a set of taboos and mores. Meanwhile, the problems tackled incisively by Japanese mystery works are often reflections of the larger societal problems posed by their time—including Westernization, imperial expansion, defeat in the Second World War, the arrival of economic prosperity, the collapse of the bubble economy, political corruption, and a perception of decline in the cohesiveness of community. Through examining mysteries, we will hope to arrive at a better understanding of how Japanese literature and society speak to and alter one another.

In this course we try to understand these emotional attachments by examining the narrative of loss and redemption through which most nations in the Balkans retell their Ottoman past. We begin by considering the mythic temporality of the Romantic national narrative while focusing on specific national literary texts where the national past is retold through the formula of original wholeness, foreign invasion, Passion, and Salvation. We then proceed to unpack the structural role of the different elements of that narrative. With the help of Žižek’s theory of the subject as constituted by trauma, we think about the national fixation on the trauma of loss, and the role of trauma in the formation of national consciousness. Specific theme inquiries involve the figure of the Janissary as self and other, brotherhood and fratricide, and the writing of the national trauma on the individual physical body. Special attention is given to the general aesthetic of victimhood, the casting of the victimized national self as the object of the “other’s perverse desire.” With the help of Freud, Žižek, and Kant we consider the transformation of national victimhood into the sublimity of the national self. The main primary texts include Petar Njegoš’ Mountain Wreath (Serbia and Montenegro), Ismail Kadare’s The Castle (Albania), Anton Donchev’s Time of Parting (Bulgaria).", "sectionid": "[42374]", "section": "1", "location": "Stuart Hall 104", "coursenumber": "CMLT23401", "career": "Undergraduate", "instructor": "Angelina Ilieva", "condition": "Open", "daytime": "Mon Wed : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM"}, "CHIN103001[41039]": {"subsections": [], "name": "Elementary Modern Chinese-3", "type": "LEC", "description": "", "sectionid": "[41039]", "section": "1", "location": "Cobb Hall 304", "coursenumber": "CHIN10300", "career": "Undergraduate", "instructor": "Fangpei Cai", "condition": "Open", "daytime": "Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri : 08:30 AM-09:20 AM"}, "BUSN3611081[58467]": {"subsections": [], "name": "Application Development", "type": "LEC", "description": "Course Search", "sectionid": "[58467]", "section": "81", "location": "Gleacher Center 204", "coursenumber": "BUSN36110", "career": "Chicago Booth School", "instructor": "Donald D Eisenstein", "condition": "Open", "daytime": "Wed : 06:00 PM-09:00 PM"}, "LLSO287101[41786]": {"subsections": [], "name": "Democracy and the Politics of Wealth Redistribution", "type": "SEM", "description": "How do political institutions affect the redistribution of wealth among members of a society?

The first class will take the form of an interview. Prospective clerks will face a range of questions designed to test their approach to statutory and constitutional interpretation while gauging their familiarity with pending, recent, and seminal cases. (You will all be hired!) In subsequent classes, clerks will: (1) circulate and review cert-pool memos for actual, pending petitions for writs of certiorari. These memos help the full Court determine which cases to hear on the merits; (2) review merits briefs and write a bench memo to assist your Justice at oral argument and at Conference (where the Justices meet to resolve argued matters); (3) draft a judicial opinion assigned to your Justice (which may well entail a judgment or legal reasoning the clerk does not agree with); and (4) lead class discussion and debate for the cert-pool and merits cases for which the clerk took primary responsibility. Over the course of the seminar, each clerk will write three cert-pool memos, one bench memo, and one opinion. The seminar is aimed at students who have or seek a state or federal clerkship and those with a possible interest in clerking for a U.S. Supreme Court Justice. A firm background in constitutional law is strongly recommended, and your open-minded Justice seeks applicants with a wide array of political and jurisprudential perspectives. Grades will be based on a combination of draft opinions, class participation, cert-pool memos, and bench memos. Students may only enroll with the permission of the instructor.

For historians, progress and development used to represent the very sense of universal history, a narrative that sneaked into visions of “Western modernity” and “globalization.” But later on, they became a myth to debunk rather than an object of reflection. What has “progress” meant particularly for Latin Americans? What is, for instance, the meaning of “progress” in the Brazilian flag? How did those notions shape the one of “development” since WWII?

Students advise clients on issues such as business formation, licensing, zoning, strategic relationships, intellectual property protection, and regulatory compliance. Students become trusted advisors for their clients and have the opportunity to consult with clients on business developments; draft and review custom contracts; negotiate deals; research complex regulatory schemes and advise clients on how to comply; and occasionally appear before administrative bodies. Students may also work on policy projects to change laws that restrict low-income entrepreneurs. Policy work may involve legislative drafting, lobbying, and community organizing.

Indeed, it is guaranteed in the very etymology of the French and German words “mode” and “modernité”. Yet, on closer inspection, there is a blind spot in this relation in that fashion seems rather to be the Other of modernity than modernity itself, an Oriental colony in the heart of the West. The modern discourse of fashion testifies to the ambivalences and paradoxes in this relationship. From the beginning of the modern world until now, it is strangely split: there is fashion and fashion. Properly speaking, men’s fashion is not really fashionable. The perfectly functional suit without superfluous adornment is, in its world-wide constancy through the centuries, almost invariably classical. Its staggering universal success is due to the fact that it is the ideal modern dress: beautiful, because functional. Women’s fashion, on the contrary, is a remnant of the old, effeminate aristocracy – a frivolous frill, an all-in-all dysfunctional ornament, badly in need of thorough modernization. The „new woman“ is born in agonizing pain and perpetual fallbacks: while Chanel almost lead us toward a functional feminine form, Dior’s new look was, from this perspective, a setback: it brought back the unhealthy, restrictive corset and offered a slap in the face to the modern aesthetic dogma of „form follows function“. Fashion therefore seems to be the locus of a strange intimation of the political set against the common politics of modernity. By reading texts form Friedrich Nietzsche to Adolf Loos and Thorstein Veblen, Rousseau to Baudelaire, from Gautier, Zola and Apollinaire to Simone de Beauvoir and Pierre Bourdieu, the course will center around this blind spot between fashion and modernity and the new gendering of fashion in the bourgeois, post-feudal era.", "sectionid": "[53927]", "section": "1", "location": "Classics Building 313", "coursenumber": "CMLT25302", "career": "Undergraduate", "instructor": "Barbara Vinken", "condition": "Open", "daytime": "Thu : 03:00 PM-05:50 PM"}, "EVOL4960073[56231]": {"subsections": [], "name": "Reading: Evol Biology - Fmnh", "type": "IND", "description": "Directed individual reading courses supervised by CEB faculty members who are curators at the Field Museum.

The course takes seriously the interplay of ethnographic inquiry and theory building and of professional practice and public engagement in the development of anthropology as a modern (and postmodern) discipline. While many of the concepts explored here will be recognizable as part of the “bread and butter” of anthropological research, the course is less interested in providing a comprehensive survey of 20th century anthropology than in interrogating the discipline’s signature style of theory building through ethnographic engagements in “the field.” We start from the premise that anthropological theory is a dialectical practice through which realist arguments about the historical world(s)—and the human’s place in it—are honed through empirical encounters and pushback from anthropology’s ethnographic subjects.

From Grotius to Vitoria through Hobbes and Locke up to Mill and beyond, the one thing that modernity’s self-possessive subject cannot will to alienate, sell, or give away is himself. From this perspective, slavery can only be a relation of domination or as a vanishing moment before the enslaved contracts into servitude. In the process of installing this perspective, philosophical modernity foreclosed myriad philosophical and legal traditions of self-enslavement at the precise moment that slavery itself was generalized as the Atlantic world’s foundational mode of political and social relation. This course will explore how this philosophical bracketing of the problem of auto-enslavement enabled Atlantic modernity to bracket slavery itself as an exceptional, pathological condition; we will then explore how the philosophical coding of humans as free by anthropological default affected the social, legal, and political life of the actually enslaved. The first part of this course will track the impossibilization of auto-enslavement in early modern and Enlightenment philosophical texts on international law, political theory, Biblical hermeneutics, and abolitionism. In the second part of this course, we will examine black and white improvisations with the figure of the self-enslaving subject, reading slave narratives, legal texts and cases.", "sectionid": "[41089]", "section": "1", "location": "Walker Museum 403", "coursenumber": "ENGL55300", "career": "Graduate", "instructor": "Christopher Taylor", "condition": "Open", "daytime": "Thu : 03:00 PM-05:50 PM"}, "BSDG4010014[55015]": {"subsections": [], "name": "Non-Thesis Research 1:  Biological Sciences", "type": "RSC", "description": "", "sectionid": "[55015]", "section": "14", "location": "TBA", "coursenumber": "BSDG40100", "career": "Graduate", "instructor": "Michael Ivor Coates", "condition": "Open", "daytime": "TBA"}, "OBGY4440042[40492]": {"subsections": [], "name": "Away Rotation: OB/GYN", "type": "ROA", "description": "", "sectionid": "[40492]", "section": "42", "location": "TBA", "coursenumber": "OBGY44400", "career": "Pritzker School of Medicine", "instructor": "Staff", "condition": "Open", "daytime": "TBA"}, "BUSN3410302[43405]": {"subsections": [], "name": "Building the New Venture", "type": "LEC", "description": "Course Search", "sectionid": "[43405]", "section": "02", "location": "Charles M.

Indeed, it is guaranteed in the very etymology of the French and German words “mode” and “modernité”. Yet, on closer inspection, there is a blind spot in this relation in that fashion seems rather to be the Other of modernity than modernity itself, an Oriental colony in the heart of the West. The modern discourse of fashion testifies to the ambivalences and paradoxes in this relationship. From the beginning of the modern world until now, it is strangely split: there is fashion and fashion. Properly speaking, men’s fashion is not really fashionable. The perfectly functional suit without superfluous adornment is, in its world-wide constancy through the centuries, almost invariably classical. Its staggering universal success is due to the fact that it is the ideal modern dress: beautiful, because functional. Women’s fashion, on the contrary, is a remnant of the old, effeminate aristocracy – a frivolous frill, an all-in-all dysfunctional ornament, badly in need of thorough modernization. The „new woman“ is born in agonizing pain and perpetual fallbacks: while Chanel almost lead us toward a functional feminine form, Dior’s new look was, from this perspective, a setback: it brought back the unhealthy, restrictive corset and offered a slap in the face to the modern aesthetic dogma of „form follows function“. Fashion therefore seems to be the locus of a strange intimation of the political set against the common politics of modernity. By reading texts form Friedrich Nietzsche to Adolf Loos and Thorstein Veblen, Rousseau to Baudelaire, from Gautier, Zola and Apollinaire to Simone de Beauvoir and Pierre Bourdieu, the course will center around this blind spot between fashion and modernity and the new gendering of fashion in the bourgeois, post-feudal era.", "sectionid": "[53928]", "section": "1", "location": "Classics Building 313", "coursenumber": "CMLT35202", "career": "Graduate", "instructor": "Barbara Vinken", "condition": "Open", "daytime": "Thu : 03:00 PM-05:50 PM"}, "CHEM337001[54337]": {"subsections": [], "name": "RNA Special Topics", "type": "LEC", "description": "Students will learn principles of RNA structure and function, RNA catalysis, and RNA molecular cell biology as they relate to the field of RNA metabolism.

Historians of religion often begin by turning to texts: either sacred texts, or, in the absence of such scriptures, descriptions of belief and practice by observers from outside the faith. Archaeologists focus their attention on the spaces and traces of religious practice—or at least those that survive—while art historians begin by examining images of deities and religious rites. Yet we often fail to see the extent to which the questions which we ask of all of these diverse sources are conditioned by Christian rhetoric about pagan worship. In this course, we compare two moments when Christians encountered \"pagans\": during the initial Christian construction of a discourse on paganism (and, more broadly, a discourse on religion) during the late Roman empire and during the Spanish discovery of the New World. Our course examines silences and absences in the textual and material records, as well as the divergences between texts and objects, in order to further our understanding of ancient religious practice. We will begin to see the many ways in which, as scholars of religion, we are in effect still Christian theologians, paving the way for new approaches to the study of ancient religion.", "sectionid": "[43846]", "section": "1", "location": "Regenstein Library 207", "coursenumber": "LACS40301", "career": "Graduate", "instructor": "Clifford Ando, Claudia Brittenham", "condition": "Open", "daytime": "Wed : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM"}, "ENGL5990013[41102]": {"subsections": [], "name": "Reading and Research: English", "type": "IND", "description": "", "sectionid": "[41102]", "section": "13", "location": "TBA", "coursenumber": "ENGL59900", "career": "Graduate", "instructor": "Janice L Knight", "condition": "Open", "daytime": "TBA"}, "REES3970089[43875]": {"subsections": [], "name": "Reading/Research", "type": "IND", "description": "", "sectionid": "[43875]", "section": "89", "location": "TBA", "coursenumber": "REES39700", "career": "Graduate", "instructor": "Staff", "condition": "Open", "daytime": "TBA"}, "DVSC5010051[58407]": {"subsections": [], "name": "Research: Divinity", "type": "RSC", "description": "Readings and Research for working on their PhD", "sectionid": "[58407]", "section": "51", "location": "TBA", "coursenumber": "DVSC50100", "career": "Graduate", "instructor": "Curtis Evans", "condition": "Open", "daytime": "TBA"}, "PPHA5000021[56832]": {"subsections": [], "name": "Internship: Public Policy", "type": "IND", "description": "Elective course credit may be received in conjunction with an internship if the student writes a paper of academic caliber under the supervision of a Harris School faculty advisor.

Our course examines silences and absences in the textual and material records, as well as the divergences between texts and objects, in order to further our understanding of ancient religious practice.

Psychotherapy for persons presenting with chronic distress present a unique set of challenges. Most research in psychotherapy outcomes suggest that one of the most important factors associated with successful treatment is the relationship between the client and therapist. Traditionally, focus on the therapeutic relationship has been the purview of experiential and psychodynamic therapies. However, in the past ten years, three behavioral models of psychotherapy have been introduced that focus on the relationship in the therapy session. To varying degrees, these therapies are based on a large body of knowledge developed over the past several decades in the study of verbal behavior. In this class, participants will be introduced to a behavioral conceptualization of phenomena such as emotion, memory, cognition, and beliefs. Discussion of these private behaviors will conclude in a presentation of a behavioral theory of the “sense of self”. For the remainder of the course, participants will revisit these concepts as they apply to discussion of three influential behavioral therapies. First, participants will become acquainted with specific clinician behaviors that foster the curative role of the therapist as articulated in Functional Analytic Psychotherapy (FAP) developed by Robert Kohlenberg. Second, participants will discuss the role of verbal behavior in human suffering and the “recontextualization” of painful private experience presented in Acceptance and Commitment Therapy developed by Steven Hayes. Finally, participants will be introduced to the therapeutic dialectic of acceptance and change as outlined in Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) developed by Marsha Linehan. The goal of the course will be to briefly introduce participants to FAP and ACT and to provide an overview of the principles and strategies of DBT that explicitly address the diffuse, troubling experiences presented by most chronically distressed individuals.", "sectionid": "[42614]", "section": "2", "location": "TBA", "coursenumber": "SSAD40403", "career": "Graduate", "instructor": "Jancey Wickstrom", "condition": "Closed", "daytime": "Mon : 09:00 AM-11:50 AM"}, "PBHS4910024[55659]": {"subsections": [], "name": "Ph.

We then proceed to unpack the structural role of the different elements of that narrative. With the help of Žižek’s theory of the subject as constituted by trauma, we think about the national fixation on the trauma of loss, and the role of trauma in the formation of national consciousness. Specific theme inquiries involve the figure of the Janissary as self and other, brotherhood and fratricide, and the writing of the national trauma on the individual physical body. Special attention is given to the general aesthetic of victimhood, the casting of the victimized national self as the object of the “other’s perverse desire.” With the help of Freud, Žižek, and Kant we consider the transformation of national victimhood into the sublimity of the national self.

China is growing stronger and more influential in every domain worldwide and likely to increasingly threaten the status quo. The U.S., meanwhile, finds itself in the grips of a populist movement led by President Trump, who is openly critical of China. The relationship, which was already mistrustful, has grown even more fragile and anxious in recent weeks with talk of tariffs, Taiwan, and the South China Sea. The accusations and threats suggest that we are likely to witness greater turbulence than what we have experienced in the past forty years. The reality is that both nations need each other; both have significant economic, political, and security interests at stake. If the two nations learn how to collaborate, they could conceivably solve the world’s greatest problems. Alternatively, if they elect to contest each other at every turn, the result will be global instability and crisis. Clearly, a new framework for cooperation and collaboration is needed – quite possibly “a new deal,” in the language of President Trump. What will constitute such a deal? How will it work? How likely is a deal, and, if one does occur, will it survive the volatility of an America First foreign policy? This seminar will advocate that the two nations develop a new, fifty-year treaty in the form of a strategic cooperation agreement. We will define the rationale and the case for action, draft major components of the proposed treaty, outline the pathway required for adoption, and transmit our end-product to foreign policy authorities in Washington and Beijing. Grading will be determined by class participation and by performance across three short papers.

Contemporary critics often consider this novel the archetypal fictional work about terrorism, as it is based on the bomb attack that occurred in Greenwich in 1888. The Secret Agent demonstrates, however, much more than its prophetic significance rediscovered after 9/11. Therefore, the course seeks how the novel’s relevance stems in equal measure from Conrad’s interest in a wider political process and his distrust of state power; in particular, the course explores how these forces determine the individual caught in a confining situation. We read The Secret Agent as a political novel, that struggle for solutions defies chaos as well as an imposition of a single ideology or one authorial point of view. Its ambiguities and political antinomies allow for interdisciplinary readings that also present an opportunity to critically overview the established approaches to main Conradian themes. In analyzing the formation of the narrative’s ideology we discuss Conrad’s historical pessimism that demonstrates with sustained irony how capitalism breeds social injustice that, in turn, breeds anarchism. The class also focuses on how the novel exposes duplicity in staging surveillance, terrorism, as well as adjacent forms of violence or sacrifice.

Finally, we provide an overview of the mechanics of developing and implementing clinical research, including grant writing, regulatory issues, and quality assurance. Along the way, we will be teaching core statistical concepts including prevalence, risk ratios, and sensitivity and validation techniques. The objectives are for students to obtain an understanding of how and why to perform clinical research and to do so in an ethical and responsible manner.", "sectionid": "[43377]", "section": "1", "location": "Billings Hospital P315", "coursenumber": "BIOS29327", "career": "Undergraduate", "instructor": "Valerie Press", "condition": "Open", "daytime": "Mon Wed : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM"}, "CMST5990017[55334]": {"subsections": [], "name": "Reading And Research: Cmst", "type": "IND", "description": "", "sectionid": "[55334]", "section": "17", "location": "TBA", "coursenumber": "CMST59900", "career": "Graduate", "instructor": "Daniel Morgan", "condition": "Open", "daytime": "TBA"}, "PLSC4010089[57802]": {"subsections": [], "name": "Thesis Preparation: Polsci", "type": "THE", "description": "This is an independent study course related to master's paper or dissertation research.", "sectionid": "[57802]", "section": "89", "location": "TBA", "coursenumber": "PLSC40100", "career": "Graduate", "instructor": "Staff", "condition": "Open", "daytime": "TBA"}, "PPHA558001[42724]": {"subsections": [], "name": "Persp Soc Welfare Politics", "type": "LEC", "description": "", "sectionid": "[42724]", "section": "1", "location": "TBA", "coursenumber": "PPHA55800", "career": "Graduate", "instructor": "Evelyn Brodkin", "condition": "Open", "daytime": "Tue : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM"}, "REES398141[53944]": {"subsections": [], "name": "Kurosawa and His Sources", "type": "SEM", "description": "This interdisciplinary graduate and advanced undergraduate course focuses on ten films of Akira Kurosawa which were based on literary sources ranging from Ryunosuke Akutagawa, Georges Simenon, and Shakespeare to Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, Gorky, and Arseniev.

But it also is important to recognize the differences between cost-benefit analyses of social programs and of private sector investments. Here we examine how the concepts of consumer and producer surplus discussed in your economics courses guide us in formulating evaluation questions and choosing appropriate outcome measures. Most of the course examines the strategies for evaluating the impact that government policies have on alternative outcomes. The key question here is what would have been the outcome had individuals, neighborhoods, state, etc., not been exposed to the policy. The impact of the policy is the difference between the actual outcome and this counterfactual outcome.

Does a poetic image necessarily entail a representational mode of thinking, or are their variations that resist literary mimesis?

From this perspective, slavery can only be a relation of domination or as a vanishing moment before the enslaved contracts into servitude.

The aim of the course is not only to give students a close familiarity with our two authors and some of the scholarship surrounding them, but also, more broadly, to think through the relationship between political theory and history.

While in an age of global migrations, multilingual speakers have come to outnumber the number of monolingual speakers, literary studies continue to privilege works aimed at a monolingual audience. This is particularly the case in the United States, where “English-only” attitudes have dominated discourse for over a century. This course instead explores literary works that take up residence in the space between two or more languages, whether national or regional—as well as those that attempt to dodge semantic systems altogether. From modernist collage and transense to contemporary poetry of exile, migration, and diaspora, the works we will study, lodged between tongues, lend nuance and fascination to debates surrounding “global literature” and untranslatability. We will examine the formal and social prompts and repercussions of experiments in polylingualism, barbarism, dialect, creole, and thwarted translation, and will delve into examples of the potential for mixed/new media poetics to accommodate multiple linguistic systems. While it is not at all necessary for students to be fluent in more than one language to take this course, some experience learning or attempting to learn languages beyond English is essential.

Bronze objects, in the forms of vessels, weapons, and musical instruments, were reserved for the upper ruling class of the society and were used mostly as paraphernalia during rituals and feasting. “Bronze Age” in China also indicates the emergence and eventual maturation of states with their bureaucratic systems, the presence of urban centers, a sophisticated writing system, and advanced craft producing industries, especially metal production.

At the same time, we will question whether Freud’s reflections on the psychopathologies of modern culture can in fact help to explain specific structural and social transformations in the 19th century public sphere, like the construction of modern sewer systems, the legal regulation of sexual acts, or the development of obscenity law. Finally, we will interrogate how the unconscious operates as a site of theoretical interest within Marxist and postcolonial critiques of modern imperialism.

Students who have completed fifty percent of the credits needed for graduation may be licensed to appear, under the supervision of the clinical teacher, in state and federal trial and appellate courts pursuant to court rules and practices. Students engaged in legislative advocacy may research and draft legislation and supporting materials, devise and implement strategies to obtain the enactment or defeat of legislation, negotiate with representatives of various interest groups, and testify in legislative hearings. In addition to discrete advocacy skills such as cross-examination, discovery planning, and legislative drafting, the course aims to provide students with an understanding of the relationships between individual advocacy tasks and the ultimate goals of clients, between litigation and legislative advocacy, and between advocacy on behalf of individual clients and advocacy for systemic change. Prior or contemporaneous enrollment in Law and the Mental Health System is encouraged, but not required, for all students.

Contemporary critics often consider this novel the archetypal fictional work about terrorism, as it is based on the bomb attack that occurred in Greenwich in 1888. The Secret Agent demonstrates, however, much more than its prophetic significance rediscovered after 9/11. Therefore, the course seeks how the novel’s relevance stems in equal measure from Conrad’s interest in a wider political process and his distrust of state power; in particular, the course explores how these forces determine the individual caught in a confining situation. We read The Secret Agent as a political novel, that struggle for solutions defies chaos as well as an imposition of a single ideology or one authorial point of view. Its ambiguities and political antinomies allow for interdisciplinary readings that also present an opportunity to critically overview the established approaches to main Conradian themes. In analyzing the formation of the narrative’s ideology we discuss Conrad’s historical pessimism that demonstrates with sustained irony how capitalism breeds social injustice that, in turn, breeds anarchism. The class also focuses on how the novel exposes duplicity in staging surveillance, terrorism, as well as adjacent forms of violence or sacrifice.

We begin by considering the mythic temporality of the Romantic national narrative while focusing on specific national literary texts where the national past is retold through the formula of original wholeness, foreign invasion, Passion, and Salvation. We then proceed to unpack the structural role of the different elements of that narrative. With the help of Žižek’s theory of the subject as constituted by trauma, we think about the national fixation on the trauma of loss, and the role of trauma in the formation of national consciousness. Specific theme inquiries involve the figure of the Janissary as self and other, brotherhood and fratricide, and the writing of the national trauma on the individual physical body. Special attention is given to the general aesthetic of victimhood, the casting of the victimized national self as the object of the “other’s perverse desire.” With the help of Freud, Žižek, and Kant we consider the transformation of national victimhood into the sublimity of the national self.

Third, aesthetic means have been used to convey scientific conceptions (e.g., through illustrations in scientific volumes or through aesthetically affective and effective writing). Finally, philosophers have stepped back to consider the relationship between scientific knowing and aesthetic comprehension (e.g., Kant, Bas van Fraassen); much of the discussion of this latter will focus on the relation between images and what they represent.

For historians, progress and development used to represent the very sense of universal history, a narrative that sneaked into visions of “Western modernity” and “globalization.” But later on, they became a myth to debunk rather than an object of reflection. What has “progress” meant particularly for Latin Americans? What is, for instance, the meaning of “progress” in the Brazilian flag? How did those notions shape the one of “development” since WWII?

Law students serve as Child Advocate for individual children, and are responsible for advocating for the best interests of the assigned child on issues relating to safe repatriation, legal relief, care, custody and release. Each student meets weekly with the child at the detention facility, and advocates on behalf of the child with federal officials, including immigration judges and asylum officers, under the supervision of Young Center attorneys. Since there currently is no substantive best interests of the child standard under the Immigration and Nationality Act, students look to international human rights law, including the Convention on the Rights of the Child, state child welfare law, and the child protection laws of the child’s home country. Policy Advocacy: In addition to serving as Child Advocate, clinic students have the opportunity to engage in legislative and policy advocacy aimed at improving the immigration system for children in removal proceedings. This is an especially critical time since the government projects 70,000 children will arrive at the border this year. Young Center students will do policy advocacy aimed at reforming procedural and substantive legal protections, including the appointment of counsel for immigrant children and incorporation of a substantive best interests of the child standard in the Immigration and Nationality Act.

It will explore historical and theoretical issues related to the mutual interactions between cinema and theatre also discussing cinematographic techniques in playwriting as exemplified in plays by Henrik Ibsen (e.g. Peer Gynt) and August Strindberg (e.g. A Dream Play and The Ghost Sonata). Throughout most of his creative career Bergman worked both in theatre and film and even if he is mostly known outside of Sweden as a film director, his theatrical career was as innovative.

The Secret Agent demonstrates, however, much more than its prophetic significance rediscovered after 9/11. Therefore, the course seeks how the novel’s relevance stems in equal measure from Conrad’s interest in a wider political process and his distrust of state power; in particular, the course explores how these forces determine the individual caught in a confining situation. We read The Secret Agent as a political novel, that struggle for solutions defies chaos as well as an imposition of a single ideology or one authorial point of view. Its ambiguities and political antinomies allow for interdisciplinary readings that also present an opportunity to critically overview the established approaches to main Conradian themes. In analyzing the formation of the narrative’s ideology we discuss Conrad’s historical pessimism that demonstrates with sustained irony how capitalism breeds social injustice that, in turn, breeds anarchism.

During the so-called Fourth Crusade, the Sack of Constantinople has led to large-scale pillaging of the Byzantine capital and the transfer to Venice of countless Byzantine artifacts, among them are liturgical items, reliquaries, icons, and architectural spoils. How were these artifacts employed in the Venetian Lagoon for religious and political ends after being disassociated from their original contexts? What transformations did they experience with regard to usage and appearance? What kinds of new ceremonies, both religious and secular, did they inspire? What was their impact on artistic creativity and religious life in their new environment?

The aim of the course is not only to give students a close familiarity with our two authors and some of the scholarship surrounding them, but also, more broadly, to think through the relationship between political theory and history. How might political theory guide the writing of history, and how can history contribute to theorizing politics? What can our reading of Herodotus and Thucydides tell us about how to think about these questions in different eras and contexts?

In this course we try to understand these emotional attachments by examining the narrative of loss and redemption through which most nations in the Balkans retell their Ottoman past. We begin by considering the mythic temporality of the Romantic national narrative while focusing on specific national literary texts where the national past is retold through the formula of original wholeness, foreign invasion, Passion, and Salvation. We then proceed to unpack the structural role of the different elements of that narrative. With the help of Žižek’s theory of the subject as constituted by trauma, we think about the national fixation on the trauma of loss, and the role of trauma in the formation of national consciousness. Specific theme inquiries involve the figure of the Janissary as self and other, brotherhood and fratricide, and the writing of the national trauma on the individual physical body. Special attention is given to the general aesthetic of victimhood, the casting of the victimized national self as the object of the “other’s perverse desire.” With the help of Freud, Žižek, and Kant we consider the transformation of national victimhood into the sublimity of the national self.

In this course we try to understand these emotional attachments by examining the narrative of loss and redemption through which most nations in the Balkans retell their Ottoman past. We begin by considering the mythic temporality of the Romantic national narrative while focusing on specific national literary texts where the national past is retold through the formula of original wholeness, foreign invasion, Passion, and Salvation. We then proceed to unpack the structural role of the different elements of that narrative. With the help of Žižek’s theory of the subject as constituted by trauma, we think about the national fixation on the trauma of loss, and the role of trauma in the formation of national consciousness. Specific theme inquiries involve the figure of the Janissary as self and other, brotherhood and fratricide, and the writing of the national trauma on the individual physical body. Special attention is given to the general aesthetic of victimhood, the casting of the victimized national self as the object of the “other’s perverse desire.” With the help of Freud, Žižek, and Kant we consider the transformation of national victimhood into the sublimity of the national self.

Rather, scholars today recognize that colonial encounters were complex culture, political, and economic fields of interaction. Africans actively adopted, reworked, and contested colonizers' policies and projects, and Europeans drew heavily from these encounters to form liberal conceptions of self, nation, and society.

Topics include economic inequality and the demand for redistribution, the difference in redistribution between democracy and dictatorship, the role of globalization in policymaking, and the effects of redistribution on political stability and change.", "sectionid": "[41784]", "section": "1", "location": "Pick Hall 506", "coursenumber": "PLSC28710", "career": "Undergraduate", "instructor": "Michael Albertus", "condition": "Closed", "daytime": "Mon Wed : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM"}, "NEHC4900034[54976]": {"subsections": [], "name": "Thesis Research: Nehc", "type": "THE", "description": "", "sectionid": "[54976]", "section": "34", "location": "TBA", "coursenumber": "NEHC49000", "career": "Graduate", "instructor": "Orit Bashkin", "condition": "Open", "daytime": "TBA"}, "SOSC1530015[42610]": {"subsections": [], "name": "Classics Soc/Polit Thought-3", "type": "SEM", "description": "", "sectionid": "[42610]", "section": "15", "location": "Cobb Hall 319", "coursenumber": "SOSC15300", "career": "Undergraduate", "instructor": "Patchen Markell", "condition": "Open", "daytime": "Mon Wed : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM"}, "BSDG550001[53324]": {"subsections": [], "name": "Sci Integrity/Ethical Conduct", "type": "LEC", "description": "", "sectionid": "[53324]", "section": "1", "location": "TBA", "coursenumber": "BSDG55000", "career": "Graduate", "instructor": "Stephen C Meredith, Victoria E Prince", "condition": "Open", "daytime": "Mon Tue Thu : 05:30 PM-07:20 PM"}, "PRAC300007[42834]": {"subsections": [], "name": "Field Practicum: Core", "type": "PRA", "description": "In the first year, fieldwork is integrated with Core and elective courses to provide direct practice experience with people in distress and the institutions established to provide service.

This class mirrors the real world work experience of both litigators and corporate lawyers: students will receive hands-on substantive and client-development experience and will be expected to manage and meet expectations and deadlines while exercising a high level of professionalism. As a result, this class is likely to involve a significant commitment (with a substantial amount of work to be completed outside of class). Clients will include the following: Amazon, Baxter Healthcare, Booth School of Business New Venture Challenge (Spring Quarter), Chicago Symphony Orchestra, GE Healthcare, Honeywell, IBM, Microsoft, Nike, Northern Trust, Schreiber Foods, and Verizon Communications. Students will be required to sign nondisclosure agreements with participating clients. Corporate Lab students also will have the opportunity to negotiate a simulated transaction across the table from Northwestern Law students as part of the negotiation workshop component of the Corporate Lab (Autumn Quarter).

Since the late 1990s, a reassessment of the legacy of the NLAC has been taking shape as scholars have begun to interrogate its canonical status in the face of a changed political climate. In the sphere of filmmaking, contemporary Latin American new wave cinemas are also grappling with that legacy-sometimes disavowing it, sometimes appropriating it.

The course objective is to show that while colonialism was brutal and oppressive, it was by no means a unidirectional process of domination in which Europeans plundered the African continent and enforced a wholesale adoption of European culture. Rather, scholars today recognize that colonial encounters were complex culture, political, and economic fields of interaction. Africans actively adopted, reworked, and contested colonizers' policies and projects, and Europeans drew heavily from these encounters to form liberal conceptions of self, nation, and society. Over the course of the quarter, students will learn about forms of personhood, political economy, and everyday life in the twentieth century.

After taking this course, you should improve your ability to determine a firm's accounting policy for a particular type of transaction and to determine how that policy choice affects its primary financial statements. You will also learn how to question whether these effects fairly reflect the underlying economics of the firm's transactions. Asking these questions involves an interplay between accounting, economics, finance, law and business strategy. You should therefore greatly improve your ability to use an accounting report as part of an overall assessment of the firm's strategy and the potential rewards and risks of dealing with the firm. The teaching approach will be a roughly equal combination of lecture time and demanding case applications of the lecture material that will involve group case assignments that will form the basis for in-class discussion of the cases. The technical knowledge acquired from the lecture material is applied to cases where the main goal is to examine how the reported financial statements would differ if the firm had used different accounting policies. The focus is on modifying the reported financial statements in order to obtain the cleanest possible inputs for use in such applications as equity valuation, transaction structuring and credit analysis. The topics to be discussed are likely to include the accounting for, and interpretation of: revenue recognition, intercorporate investments, organizational structures (e.g., franchising), debt, and leases. Intensive group hand-in cases will be used to illustrate how the flexibility in financial reporting can reflect both the economics of the firm and the incentives of the managers creating the financial statements. It is REQUIRED that students registering for this course have prior exposure to accounting course work, at least at the level of Fundamentals of Accounting for Attorneys (LAWS 79112 or 53260), but with a strong preference for the stronger background knowledge provided by the Booth course Financial Accounting (B30000).", "sectionid": "[40571]", "section": "01", "location": "Laird Bell Quadrangle E", "coursenumber": "LAWS43248", "career": "Law School", "instructor": "Philip Berger", "condition": "Open", "daytime": "Tue : 09:45 AM-01:15 PM"}, "NURB3990070[55927]": {"subsections": [], "name": "Readings: Neurobiology", "type": "IND", "description": "", "sectionid": "[55927]", "section": "70", "location": "TBA", "coursenumber": "NURB39900", "career": "Graduate", "instructor": "Nanduri Prabhakar", "condition": "Open", "daytime": "TBA"}, "GEOG288001[42335]": {"subsections": [], "name": "History of Cartography", "type": "SEM", "description": "This course offers a grand overview of the key developments in mapmaking throughout history worldwide, from pre-literate cartography to the modern interactive digital environment.

The tools of engineering are important in making and translating basic discoveries in other fields into new intellectual opportunities and, sometimes, useful technologies. Institute for Molecular Engineering The Institute for Molecular Engineering (IME) is founded on the principle of collaborative problem-solving, not rigid academic disciplines. It is at the forefront of an emerging field that has the potential to address fundamental problems of societal import. This exciting new field involves the incorporation of synthetic molecular building blocks into functional systems that will impact technologies from advanced medical therapies to quantum computing. Created in partnership with Argonne National Laboratory, the IME builds on the tradition of collaboration and cutting-edge research well established at Argonne and the University of Chicago. It conducts research at the intersection of chemical, electrical, mechanical, and biological engineering, as well as materials, biological, and physical sciences. The institute’s exploration of innovative technologies in nanoscale manipulation and design at a molecular scale has the potential for impact in such areas as energy, health care, and the environment. Major Program in Molecular Engineering The BS degree program in Molecular Engineering offers undergraduates a cutting-edge engineering curriculum built on a strong foundation in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology. Courses are designed to develop quantitative reasoning and problem-solving skills; to introduce engineering analysis of physical, chemical, and biological systems; and to address open-ended technological questions across a spectrum of disciplines. The program will both prepare undergraduates for a wide variety of careers in technology-focused industries and position graduates for further postgraduate study in such fields as science, engineering, medicine, business, or law. The aim is to introduce invention and design, along with inquiry and discovery, as fruitful and complementary intellectual activities. Majors are able to choose from two quantitative engineering analysis tracks, one aimed at engineering with a biological, chemical, and soft materials emphasis, and one geared toward applied physics. The applied physics track, offered in close collaboration with the Department of Physics, is one of the first initiatives worldwide to formally educate quantum engineers at the undergraduate level. MENG 29500 Engineering Design is a 300-unit design course offered as a capstone, in which student teams spend an intensive quarter working with a faculty mentor to solve an open-ended problem, for example, analyzing chemical and biological properties of cancer cells to develop new treatment and delivery vehicles or harnessing the properties of electrons in materials to develop quantum information technologies. The course also combines technical skills with an exploration of economics, regulatory and legal issues, and ethics. Major Program Requirements 1. A strong and broad background in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology. It is imperative for a modern engineer to have a strong and broad background in the sciences. Traditional engineering disciplines have had requirements in math, chemistry, and physics for decades and many programs have evolved to require biology as well. The highly interdisciplinary nature of Molecular Engineering requires a foundation built across the mathematical, physical, and biological sciences. Students are encouraged to complete their general education requirements at the highest level for which they are prepared. This will position them better to take advantage of advanced electives and research opportunities. As discussed in more detail below, there will be two tracks for Molecular Engineering majors, one aimed towards engineering with a biological, chemical, and soft materials emphasis, and one aimed towards applied physics. Students in the former track will follow precedent set by Chemistry and Biological Sciences majors in that they will likely take chemistry in year 1, physics in year 2, and follow the recommended mathematics courses in the Chemistry curriculum. Students in the latter track will follow precedent set by Physics majors in that they will likely take physics in year 1, follow the mathematics guidelines of Physics majors, and take chemistry in year 2. 2. MENG 26030 Introduction to Engineering Analysis. One of the first courses for all Molecular Engineering majors, this course teaches students to apply mathematical methods towards solving problems that cut across multiple engineering sub-disciplines. A major objective of the course is to teach simple programming skills and computational methods in applied mathematics, including the use of engineering software such as Matlab, Mathematica, Comsol, and elements of Python. The skills that are introduced here will be further developed and strengthened throughout the rest of the curriculum. 3. Two quantitative engineering analysis tracks: Biological, Chemical, and Soft Materials Engineering and Quantum Engineering. Reflecting the research and education themes of the IME, two highly intertwined but recognizably different tracks for the major are available to students. One is aimed at preparing students oriented towards biological, chemical, and soft materials engineering, and the other is aimed at preparing students oriented towards engineering of quantum-based materials, devices, and processes. The latter track is offered in close collaboration with the Department of Physics. The main difference in the tracks relates to a choice between two sequences of three courses under the heading of quantitative engineering analysis. 4. MENG 29500 Engineering Design (300-unit capstone course). This “immersion” design course teaches students how to bring combinations of fundamental science and engineering together to solve open-ended and challenging engineering problems. It also serves as a vehicle to teach other equally important non-technical skills, including: • Problem identification: technology analysis, competitive analysis, market analysis, stakeholder analysis, product definition • Impact of the project, including sociological and engineering ethics • Project planning • Project economics: costs, value/investment analysis, risk analysis and adjustment • Prototyping, experimental design, data analysis, error analysis • IP: patenting, prior art, patentability • Legal and regulatory analysis • Proposing, presenting and reporting • Teamwork IME faculty and fellows will propose open-ended projects for which they will serve as mentors. Students will work together in groups of three. 5. Materials and advanced electives (3 required courses in the major). The major is offered in such a way as to allow for considerable flexibility for students to tailor their programs along individualized trajectories, with help from faculty advisors. Not only can students choose between two tracks, but they can further build breadth or depth through their choice of a materials course and advanced electives. Moreover, we anticipate that our students will use their general electives outside of the major requirements to strengthen their backgrounds in specific areas of interest, also in consultation with Molecular Engineering advisors, to achieve desired outcomes such as preparation for graduate school in more traditional engineering disciplines. 6. Laboratory skills and hands-on experience. Critical skills that molecular engineers must acquire as part of their educational program include the ability to apply knowledge of mathematics, science, and engineering and the ability to design and conduct experiments, as well as the ability to analyze and interpret data. Molecular Engineering majors develop these skills through lab components associated with required courses in the physical and biological sciences, Molecular Engineering courses including MENG 26101-26102 Transport Phenomena I: Forces + Flows; Transport Phenomena II, MENG 26201-26202 Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics I-II, MENG 29500 Engineering Design, and some of the advanced electives such as MENG 27300 Polymer Physics and Engineering. We also anticipate that many Molecular Engineering students will receive advanced laboratory experience pursuing undergraduate research projects. 7. Non-technical skills. Many decades of workshops and panels engaging stakeholders in academia and industry, often associated with the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET), have identified criteria for outcomes of students in accredited engineering education programs. Although there is no thought of seeking ABET accreditation for the Molecular Engineering major, many ABET criteria, particularly those related to non-technological skills, are viewed as essential to incorporate into the Molecular Engineering major. Examples of student outcomes that fall into this category include: (a) an ability to formulate or design a system, process, or program to meet desired needs, (b) an ability to function on multidisciplinary teams, (c) an understanding of professional and ethical responsibility, (d) an ability to communicate effectively, (e) the broad education necessary to understand the impact of solutions in a global and societal context, (f) a recognition of the need for and an ability to engage in life-long learning, and (g) a knowledge of contemporary issues. Many of these outcomes will be addressed through both the Molecular Engineering degree curriculum (emphasized in the design sequence and the research colloquium) and the College general education requirements. Students who are able to both develop and articulate these skills will be positioned favorably for employment in industry and for postgraduate study (engineering, medicine, law, and business administration). Entering the Program Students must indicate their intent to pursue the BS program at the end of the Autumn Quarter in their second year of study by completing the Intent to Pursue Molecular Engineering questionnaire (available on the IME website). They begin the engineering curriculum in the following Spring Quarter with enrollment in either MENG 26010 Engineering Principles of Conservation or MENG 26020 Engineering Electrodynamics. Both courses require the completion of their stated prerequisites. Students should work with their advisers early in their first year of study to plan for those prerequisites to be completed in a timely manner.

The overall objective of the program is to provide basic engineering tools and ways of thinking to students that augment scientific approaches and problem solving skills. Minor Program Requirements Before a student can declare the minor in molecular engineering, the student must: Complete the general education requirements in mathematics and physical or biological sciences Earn a B or higher in MENG 20000 Introduction to Emerging Technologies Following completion of the general education requirements and MENG 20000 Introduction to Emerging Technologies (with a grade of B or better), students may apply to the director of undergraduate studies of the Institute for Molecular Engineering for admission into the minor in molecular engineering program. A student must receive the director of undergraduate studies’ approval of the minor program on a form obtained from the student's College adviser. Once signed by the director, this form must then be returned to the student's College adviser by the end of Spring Quarter of the student's third year. To earn the minor in molecular engineering, a student must complete five molecular engineering courses chosen in consultation with the director of undergraduate studies. Before meeting with the director, students should invest some thought into which courses they would like to complete for the minor and how those courses relate as a set. MENG 20000 Introduction to Emerging Technologies and MENG 29700 Undergraduate Research for Molecular Engineering must be among the five courses counted toward the minor. In rare cases, courses offered by other departments and programs may be approved by the director of undergraduate studies as substitutes for courses listed above. Courses in the minor program may not be (1) double counted with the student's major(s) or with other minors, or (2) counted toward general education requirements. Courses in the minor must be taken for quality grades, and more than half of the requirements for the minor must be met by registering for courses bearing University of Chicago course numbers. Summary of Requirements for the Minor in Molecular Engineering MENG 20000 Introduction to Emerging Technologies * 100 MENG 29700 Undergraduate Research for Molecular Engineering 100 Three additional courses in Molecular Engineering or other programs ** 300 Total Units 500 * With a grade of B or higher ** Courses not in Molecular Engineering must be approved by the director of undergraduate studies. Grading In order to qualify for the BS degree, a GPA of 2.0 or higher (with no grade lower than C-) is needed in all courses required in the major. Students majoring in Molecular Engineering must receive quality grades in all courses required in the degree program. All courses in the minor must be taken for quality grades. Nonmajors and nonminors may take Molecular Engineering courses on a P/F basis; only grades of C- or higher constitute passing work. Honors Students who pursue a substantive research project with a faculty member of the Institute for Molecular Engineering are encouraged to write and defend an honors thesis based on their work.

Clients will include the following: Amazon, Baxter Healthcare, Booth School of Business New Venture Challenge (Spring Quarter), Chicago Symphony Orchestra, GE Healthcare, Honeywell, IBM, Microsoft, Nike, Northern Trust, Schreiber Foods, and Verizon Communications. Students will be required to sign nondisclosure agreements with participating clients. Corporate Lab students also will have the opportunity to negotiate a simulated transaction across the table from Northwestern Law students as part of the negotiation workshop component of the Corporate Lab (Autumn Quarter). Please note that (i) students are expected to remain in the Corporate Lab for a minimum of two consecutive quarters, (ii) students may not take the Corporate Lab for more than nine credits, (iii) LL.M. students may register by instructor permission only, and (iv) this offering will not count toward seminar restrictions. Student grades will be based upon participation in the classroom, appropriate attention to client services, collaborative efforts within a team environment, and quality of work product.

We then proceed to unpack the structural role of the different elements of that narrative. With the help of Žižek’s theory of the subject as constituted by trauma, we think about the national fixation on the trauma of loss, and the role of trauma in the formation of national consciousness. Specific theme inquiries involve the figure of the Janissary as self and other, brotherhood and fratricide, and the writing of the national trauma on the individual physical body. Special attention is given to the general aesthetic of victimhood, the casting of the victimized national self as the object of the “other’s perverse desire.” With the help of Freud, Žižek, and Kant we consider the transformation of national victimhood into the sublimity of the national self.

This, in many ways, reflects the narrative eighteenth-century writers were developing about their own age. For British Whigs, the “Glorious Revolution” of 1688 had been a watershed moment at which the arbitrary rule of kings had been replaced for all time by constitutionalism; the social contract and the civil polity had triumphed over divine-right ideology, ushering in a new, beneficent era of progress. And, in the 1790s, the French Revolution fired the political imaginations of British radicals who saw the potential for a world made anew – a world of universal suffrage and gender equality, where slavery was abolished. Clearly, attaining these goals was a long way off. The debates over the structures, meanings, and nature of consent had tendrils in multiple areas of society – the law, of course, but also in understandings of sexuality, constructions of gender, economics, and colonization. Questions of rights, agency, and authority (what those categories meant, who could possess them, and who guaranteed them) were by no means settled, and, indeed, throughout the century, calls to curtail the categories of people who should have access to the sphere of political influence were often as boisterous as those to expand such access. This course will explore how a range of authors in eighteenth-century Britain figured questions of consent, rights, and authority and how the ideological debates these authors mediated continue to inform contemporary politics, cultures, and identities. We will read works by literary figures such as Daniel Defoe, Samuel Richardson, Mary Hays, Olaudah Equiano, and Mary Shelley. We will consider the writings of some of the major political philosophers of the day, as well, including John Locke, Thomas Hobbes, Mary Astell, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Thomas Paine, and Mary Wollstonecraft.

At the same time, we will question whether Freud’s reflections on the psychopathologies of modern culture can in fact help to explain specific structural and social transformations in the 19th century public sphere, like the construction of modern sewer systems, the legal regulation of sexual acts, or the development of obscenity law.

What distinguishes the Intelligentsia from other models of public intellectualism? How have various Slavic public intellectuals maintained, or broken with, this tradition? In order to establish a theoretical vocabulary, the course will begin with an introduction to several classical and contemporary theories of the role of the intellectual in society. We will then ground our inquiry in the historical invention of the Russian Intelligentsia during the mid-19th Century before setting off to analyze its 20th and 21st-century manifestations.

Some Justices, moreover, have concluded that it is typically unwise for the judiciary to enter the educational realm, lest the Supreme Court turn into a schoolboard for the entire nation. Even if such fears are overblown, however, there can be no doubt that the Court's constitutional interpretations have had significant consequences for schools charged with transforming students into citizens.

We will combine the theoretical and the practical. We will think creatively and philosophically about what could be, and work concretely on how to build it. Government is, everywhere, an industry in serious trouble. Its consumers are disenchanted and looking for alternatives, its products are failing the tests of quality and innovation, and its cost structure is too high. If governments were private firms, they’d be facing the dual prospects of either a takeover to “rescue” them or death in the competitive marketplace as their customer base migrates to newer alternatives. And, in fact, governments today face precisely those challenges. The idea behind this course is to address the government biz as exactly that: a mismanaged industry, business entity, or brand. We will study the history of the modern state and theories of how it will evolve in coming decades. We will consider what this means for the institution of government and what exactly “government” is. And we will look at what this means for the potential of private-sector, non-profit, non-governmental and trans-governmental entities to compete with the nation-state and take over its functions – and the possibilities that government can compete back and perhaps expand its own “business” line. But the course is intended to produce not just deep-thinking and new theories, but also concrete business plans. Students will be expected to identify either a new business idea or product line for a government entity to launch or a current government function that a for-profit or non-profit business can undertake to compete successfully with the public sector – and then develop a detailed business plan. This will require analyzing market opportunities, carrying out financial projections, understanding the realities of program delivery, and crafting a winning message for investors and/or voters.

Our course examines silences and absences in the textual and material records, as well as the divergences between texts and objects, in order to further our understanding of ancient religious practice.

In this course we try to understand these emotional attachments by examining the narrative of loss and redemption through which most nations in the Balkans retell their Ottoman past. We begin by considering the mythic temporality of the Romantic national narrative while focusing on specific national literary texts where the national past is retold through the formula of original wholeness, foreign invasion, Passion, and Salvation. We then proceed to unpack the structural role of the different elements of that narrative. With the help of Žižek’s theory of the subject as constituted by trauma, we think about the national fixation on the trauma of loss, and the role of trauma in the formation of national consciousness. Specific theme inquiries involve the figure of the Janissary as self and other, brotherhood and fratricide, and the writing of the national trauma on the individual physical body. Special attention is given to the general aesthetic of victimhood, the casting of the victimized national self as the object of the “other’s perverse desire.” With the help of Freud, Žižek, and Kant we consider the transformation of national victimhood into the sublimity of the national self. The main primary texts include Petar Njegoš’ Mountain Wreath (Serbia and Montenegro), Ismail Kadare’s The Castle (Albania), Anton Donchev’s Time of Parting (Bulgaria).", "sectionid": "[42378]", "section": "1", "location": "Stuart Hall 104", "coursenumber": "NEHC20573", "career": "Undergraduate", "instructor": "Angelina Ilieva", "condition": "Open", "daytime": "Mon Wed : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM"}, "GLST280011[43392]": {"subsections": [], "name": "Colonialism and Female Iconography: Bengal and Britain", "type": "SEM", "description": "The course offers a socio-historical approach to the construction, flow, and exchange of literary images of colonial and imperial women between Bengal and Britain in the nineteenth-century.

Yet we often fail to see the extent to which the questions which we ask of all of these diverse sources are conditioned by Christian rhetoric about pagan worship. In this course, we compare two moments when Christians encountered \"pagans\": during the initial Christian construction of a discourse on paganism (and, more broadly, a discourse on religion) during the late Roman empire and during the Spanish discovery of the New World. Our course examines silences and absences in the textual and material records, as well as the divergences between texts and objects, in order to further our understanding of ancient religious practice.

We will then consider Hegel’s radicalization of this project in his Philosophy of Right, which seeks to derive from the idea of rational freedom, not just formal constraints on right action, but a determinate, positive conception of what Hegel calls “ethical life”.

Most sessions are led by visiting speakers, from either outside institutions or our own faculty, who circulate their papers in advance. The session consists of a brief introduction by the speaker, followed by initial questioning by the two faculty coordinators, followed by general discussion, in which students are given priority. The topic for 2016-17 will expose students to cutting-edge work in general jurisprudence, that part of philosophy of law concerned with the central questions about the nature of law, the relationship between law and morality, and the nature of legal reasoning. We will be particularly interested in the way in which work in philosophy of language, metaethics, metaphysics, and other cognate fields of philosophy has influenced recent scholarly debates that have arisen in the wake of H.L.A. Hart’s seminal The Concept of Law (1961). Please see www.law.uchicago.edu/workshops/lawandphilosophy for additional information concerning each session. Usual participants include graduate students in philosophy, political science, and divinity, and law students. Students write a 20-25 page seminar paper at the end of the year. The paper may satisfy the Law School Substantial Writing Requirement. Students must enroll for all three quarters to receive credit. Students are admitted by permission of the instructors.

The goal is to see how ruin gazing, and its depictions (textual, imagistic, photographic, etc.) change from the ancients (Greek and Roman), to the Romantic use of ruins as a source of (pleasurable) melancholy, to the technological “advances” in targeting and decimating civilian populations that describe the Second Word War.", "sectionid": "[43838]", "section": "1", "location": "Regenstein Library 207", "coursenumber": "RLIT40010", "career": "Graduate", "instructor": "Jas Elsner, Francoise Meltzer", "condition": "Closed", "daytime": "Tue Thu : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM"}, "HEBR1500499[58337]": {"subsections": [], "name": "Intermediate Hebrew in Jerusalem", "type": "SEM", "description": "", "sectionid": "[58337]", "section": "99", "location": "TBA", "coursenumber": "HEBR15004", "career": "Undergraduate", "instructor": "Staff", "condition": "Closed", "daytime": "TBA"}, "SOSC1905399[58300]": {"subsections": [], "name": "Hong Kong Program:  Colonizations-2", "type": "SEM", "description": "", "sectionid": "[58300]", "section": "99", "location": "TBA", "coursenumber": "SOSC19053", "career": "Undergraduate", "instructor": "Alice Yao", "condition": "Closed", "daytime": "TBA"}, "GNSE296101[54341]": {"subsections": [], "name": "Pale Fire", "type": "SEM", "description": "This course is an intensive reading of Pale Fire by Nabokov.", "sectionid": "[54341]", "section": "1", "location": "Stuart Hall 105", "coursenumber": "GNSE29610", "career": "Undergraduate", "instructor": "Malynne Sternstein", "condition": "Open", "daytime": "Tue Thu : 10:30 AM-11:50 AM"}, "PSYC4970048[56454]": {"subsections": [], "name": "Readings: Psychology", "type": "IND", "description": "", "sectionid": "[56454]", "section": "48", "location": "TBA", "coursenumber": "PSYC49700", "career": "Graduate", "instructor": "Daniel Casasanto", "condition": "Open", "daytime": "TBA"}, "STAT4010013[55037]": {"subsections": [], "name": "Reading/Research: Statistics", "type": "RSC", "description": "This course allows doctoral students to receive credit for advanced work related to their dissertation topics.

Africans actively adopted, reworked, and contested colonizers' policies and projects, and Europeans drew heavily from these encounters to form liberal conceptions of self, nation, and society.

Students will do all their coursework and assigned casework at the University of Chicago with site visits to the respective Hopi legal institutions to attend oral arguments, present findings to Hopi tribal officials, and participate in judicial deliberations. In so doing, they will be directly involved in testing the socio-legal principles, theories and critiques they explore in class in the crucible of the work they do helping to lay the regulatory and legal foundations for Hopi tribal institutions. In this practicum, almost every project that a student will work on will involve important questions of first impression with respect to a wide variety of pressing, yet enduring sociolegal issues, including issues of constitutionalism (separations of powers, checks and balances, etc.), crime and punishment (criminal law enforcement and defendants' and victims' rights), civil procedure (due process, appellate procedure, motions and orders), private law (property, contract, family), pluralism (the role of Anglo-American vs. Hopi traditional norms, and alternative dispute resolution), among many others. Given the centrality of these issues to the philosophy, social science, and practice of law - whether in the context of indigenous self-governance and settler colonialism, or otherwise -we believe that there are few other opportunities like this one, where students will encounter, explore and work through, the profound governance and legal issues and discussions offered by the Hopi Tribal Law Practicum.", "sectionid": "[40650]", "section": "01", "location": "Laird Bell Quadrangle E", "coursenumber": "LAWS53359", "career": "Law School", "instructor": "M.

Our guiding inquiries will be simultaneously interpretive, theoretical, and historical: What does it mean to think of form as an “exteriorization” of one’s “will”? Whose will do these forms represent (who is the “us” in Rivera’s “our will”)? What representational strategies enable this exteriorization and dramatize its limitations? Why was the novel so often singled out, and why did some feminist writers prefer instead a collection of letters, poems, journal entries, and personal essays? These questions will inform our study of the consolidation of a self-conscious Chicago literature and its attendant literary history.

Contemporary critics often consider this novel the archetypal fictional work about terrorism, as it is based on the bomb attack that occurred in Greenwich in 1888. The Secret Agent demonstrates, however, much more than its prophetic significance rediscovered after 9/11. Therefore, the course seeks how the novel’s relevance stems in equal measure from Conrad’s interest in a wider political process and his distrust of state power; in particular, the course explores how these forces determine the individual caught in a confining situation. We read The Secret Agent as a political novel, that struggle for solutions defies chaos as well as an imposition of a single ideology or one authorial point of view. Its ambiguities and political antinomies allow for interdisciplinary readings that also present an opportunity to critically overview the established approaches to main Conradian themes. In analyzing the formation of the narrative’s ideology we discuss Conrad’s historical pessimism that demonstrates with sustained irony how capitalism breeds social injustice that, in turn, breeds anarchism.

The course takes a genealogical approach to “anthropological theory” by tracking the formation, uptake and entailment's of different problem-spaces in anthropology—that is, the distinct complex of questions-and-answers around key themes and problems, which animate the discipline’s various modes of knowledge production. The course takes seriously the interplay of ethnographic inquiry and theory building and of professional practice and public engagement in the development of anthropology as a modern (and postmodern) discipline. While many of the concepts explored here will be recognizable as part of the “bread and butter” of anthropological research, the course is less interested in providing a comprehensive survey of 20th century anthropology than in interrogating the discipline’s signature style of theory building through ethnographic engagements in “the field.” We start from the premise that anthropological theory is a dialectical practice through which realist arguments about the historical world(s)—and the human’s place in it—are honed through empirical encounters and pushback from anthropology’s ethnographic subjects. Ultimately, the course hopes to track how anthropological ways of knowing intervene in the world through the making and stabilizing of particular lived concepts; that is, we ask after theory’s historical formation and durable effects, its social life, as well as afterlives, in the discipline and beyond.", "sectionid": "[43427]", "section": "1", "location": "Wilder House 101", "coursenumber": "ANTH34201", "career": "Graduate", "instructor": "Julie Chu", "condition": "Open", "daytime": "Tue Thu : 10:30 AM-11:50 AM"}, "PSYC4970010[56432]": {"subsections": [], "name": "Readings: Psychology", "type": "IND", "description": "", "sectionid": "[56432]", "section": "10", "location": "TBA", "coursenumber": "PSYC49700", "career": "Graduate", "instructor": "William Goldstein", "condition": "Open", "daytime": "TBA"}, "SALC3990010[55739]": {"subsections": [], "name": "Informal Course: South Asia", "type": "IND", "description": "", "sectionid": "[55739]", "section": "10", "location": "TBA", "coursenumber": "SALC39900", "career": "Graduate", "instructor": "Kathleen D Morrison", "condition": "Open", "daytime": "TBA"}, "PEDS3040041[40080]": {"subsections": [], "name": "Pediatric Emergency Medicine", "type": "CLE", "description": "", "sectionid": "[40080]", "section": "41", "location": "Arranged ARR", "coursenumber": "PEDS30400", "career": "Pritzker School of Medicine", "instructor": "S Margaret Paik", "condition": "Open", "daytime": "TBA"}, "PBHS4000016[56779]": {"subsections": [], "name": "Public Health Sciences PhD Research & Training", "type": "PRA", "description": "Arrange course content and meeting times with instructor.", "sectionid": "[56779]", "section": "16", "location": "TBA", "coursenumber": "PBHS40000", "career": "Graduate", "instructor": "Habibul Ahsan", "condition": "Open", "daytime": "TBA"}, "SOSC1905799[58422]": {"subsections": [], "name": "Middle Eastern Civ in Vienna-3", "type": "SEM", "description": "", "sectionid": "[58422]", "section": "99", "location": "TBA", "coursenumber": "SOSC19057", "career": "Undergraduate", "instructor": "Philip V Bohlman", "condition": "Closed", "daytime": "TBA"}, "EMED3500040[40476]": {"subsections": [], "name": "Away Rotation: Emergency Medicine", "type": "ROA", "description": "", "sectionid": "[40476]", "section": "40", "location": "TBA", "coursenumber": "EMED35000", "career": "Pritzker School of Medicine", "instructor": "Staff", "condition": "Open", "daytime": "TBA"}, "CHEM391001[40976]": {"subsections": [], "name": "Materials Chemistry II", "type": "LEC", "description": "This course will focus on the physical properties and kinetics of materials.

Literatures across the disciplines are full of living bodies and concrete experiences, object biographies, ‘theories of things,’ a return to ‘matter,’ ‘new’ materialisms spun out of ‘old’ ones… While generative, materiality’s ubiquity also betrays a gap, an ambiguity, an absence. For what materiality is exactly remains unsure. Some seem to use it as a descriptive shorthand for the material world. Others as an analytic tending to the materialness of existence. Or as a discourse on it. For others still, it denotes the tangible effects of actions, practice, signs, and thought. Or a framework for unpacking the relationships mediating between people and things… Conjurations abound, yet seldom escape a certain circularity (“materiality studies… materiality?”). The concept has been used to frame a near infinite horizon of topics, from artefacts, of course, to cosmology, faith, finance, and absence, encompassing phenomena both enduring and ephemeral, both there and not-there. In taking on so much, has materiality outlasted its usefulness? What analytic work did it perform in the first place? With these considerations as background, through classic and recent literatures, this seminar will examine the relevance of ‘materiality’ (epistemologically, conceptually, methodologically) to anthropologies of the contemporary world, at a time when the ontologies of old are dissolving into a bubbling landscape of mixtures, hybridities, and post-humanities, which forces us to rethink basic questions of identity, agency, ethics and politics.", "sectionid": "[43532]", "section": "1", "location": "TBA", "coursenumber": "ANTH58205", "career": "Graduate", "instructor": "Francois Richard", "condition": "Closed", "daytime": "Thu : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM"}, "DVSC4510024[57277]": {"subsections": [], "name": "Rdg Crse: Spec Topic Divinity", "type": "IND", "description": "Petition with bibliography signed by instructor; enter section number from faculty list.", "sectionid": "[57277]", "section": "24", "location": "TBA", "coursenumber": "DVSC45100", "career": "Graduate", "instructor": "Martha C Nussbaum", "condition": "Open", "daytime": "TBA"}, "PORT421002[56539]": {"subsections": [], "name": "Reading And Research", "type": "IND", "description": "", "sectionid": "[56539]", "section": "2", "location": "TBA", "coursenumber": "PORT42100", "career": "Graduate", "instructor": "Ana Maria Lima", "condition": "Open", "daytime": "TBA"}, "CRES297001[53830]": {"subsections": [], "name": "Readings in Comparative Race and Ethnic Studies", "type": "RSC", "description": "Course description not available", "sectionid": "[53830]", "section": "1", "location": "TBA", "coursenumber": "CRES29700", "career": "Undergraduate", "instructor": "Staff", "condition": "Open", "daytime": "TBA"}, "PBHS4900032[55646]": {"subsections": [], "name": "Ph.

As a matter of fact, scholars of Antiquity usually refer to Armenia only when it was involved into one of the frequent military crises between East and West. The country had an important strategic position, a vast expanse of territory, and wealthy natural resources. This explains very well the efforts of the Seleucids and of Rome, and of the Iranian dynasties of the Parthians and the Sassanids, to establish a military control and cultural influence over Armenia. Both contacts with the West and the East shaped the complex identity of Armenia - a somewhat mixed identity which is rather difficult to study. Therefore, both Classical and Iranian scholars tend to neglect the role of Armenia, or to diminish its position in the balance of power: the anachronistic cliché of a Greater Armenia as a «buffer state» is still mentioned. Accordingly, the few specialists on pre-Christian Armenia hardly communicate with those other scholars. Therefore, the very marginality of the kingdom of Armenia has not stimulated neither Classical scholars, nor Iranian scholars, to show interest in Armenia as well. This course will present a comprehensive history of ancient Armenia, from its origins to the fall of the kingdom in 428 CE, in order to reconstruct the history of the Artaxiad and of the Arsacid dynasties within a geopolitical frame considering the role of Armenia between Rome and Iran.”", "sectionid": "[43169]", "section": "1", "location": "TBA", "coursenumber": "NEHC20155", "career": "Undergraduate", "instructor": "Giusto Traina", "condition": "Open", "daytime": "Tue Thu : 10:30 AM-11:50 AM"}, "BIOS232541[43205]": {"subsections": [{"sectionname": "Section 1L01 [43206] - LAB Open", "instructor": "Larsen", "daytime": "Thu : 01:30 PM-04:20 PM"}], "name": "Mammalian Ecology", "type": "LEC", "description": "This course introduces the diversity and classification of mammals and their ecological relationships.

In this course we try to understand these emotional attachments by examining the narrative of loss and redemption through which most nations in the Balkans retell their Ottoman past. We begin by considering the mythic temporality of the Romantic national narrative while focusing on specific national literary texts where the national past is retold through the formula of original wholeness, foreign invasion, Passion, and Salvation. We then proceed to unpack the structural role of the different elements of that narrative. With the help of Žižek’s theory of the subject as constituted by trauma, we think about the national fixation on the trauma of loss, and the role of trauma in the formation of national consciousness. Specific theme inquiries involve the figure of the Janissary as self and other, brotherhood and fratricide, and the writing of the national trauma on the individual physical body. Special attention is given to the general aesthetic of victimhood, the casting of the victimized national self as the object of the “other’s perverse desire.” With the help of Freud, Žižek, and Kant we consider the transformation of national victimhood into the sublimity of the national self. The main primary texts include Petar Njegoš’ Mountain Wreath (Serbia and Montenegro), Ismail Kadare’s The Castle (Albania), Anton Donchev’s Time of Parting (Bulgaria).", "sectionid": "[42380]", "section": "1", "location": "Stuart Hall 104", "coursenumber": "REES39013", "career": "Graduate", "instructor": "Angelina Ilieva", "condition": "Open", "daytime": "Mon Wed : 01:30 PM-02:50 PM"}, "SOSC263001[41580]": {"subsections": [{"sectionname": "Section 1D01 [41581] - DIS Closed", "instructor": "Staff", "daytime": "Fri : 01:30 PM-02:20 PM"}, {"sectionname": "Section 1D02 [41582] - DIS Open", "instructor": "Staff", "daytime": "Fri : 01:30 PM-02:20 PM"}, {"sectionname": "Section 1D03 [41583] - DIS Open", "instructor": "Staff", "daytime": "Fri : 01:30 PM-02:20 PM"}], "name": "Intro to Latin American Civ-3", "type": "SEM", "description": "This course introduces the history and cultures of Latin America (e.g., Mexico, Central and South America, and the Caribbean Islands).

This, in many ways, reflects the narrative eighteenth-century writers were developing about their own age. For British Whigs, the “Glorious Revolution” of 1688 had been a watershed moment at which the arbitrary rule of kings had been replaced for all time by constitutionalism; the social contract and the civil polity had triumphed over divine-right ideology, ushering in a new, beneficent era of progress. And, in the 1790s, the French Revolution fired the political imaginations of British radicals who saw the potential for a world made anew – a world of universal suffrage and gender equality, where slavery was abolished. Clearly, attaining these goals was a long way off. The debates over the structures, meanings, and nature of consent had tendrils in multiple areas of society – the law, of course, but also in understandings of sexuality, constructions of gender, economics, and colonization. Questions of rights, agency, and authority (what those categories meant, who could possess them, and who guaranteed them) were by no means settled, and, indeed, throughout the century, calls to curtail the categories of people who should have access to the sphere of political influence were often as boisterous as those to expand such access. This course will explore how a range of authors in eighteenth-century Britain figured questions of consent, rights, and authority and how the ideological debates these authors mediated continue to inform contemporary politics, cultures, and identities. We will read works by literary figures such as Daniel Defoe, Samuel Richardson, Mary Hays, Olaudah Equiano, and Mary Shelley. We will consider the writings of some of the major political philosophers of the day, as well, including John Locke, Thomas Hobbes, Mary Astell, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Thomas Paine, and Mary Wollstonecraft.

In this course we examine the modern origin of contemporary discourses specific to anxiety and their unique manifestation in cultural artifacts. To understand the complex of anxiety in the so-called Western world, we rely on the theories of Søren Kierkegaard, Martin Heidegger, Sigmund Freud, Jacques Lacan, and Alenka Zupančič; fiction by Stoker, Schnitzler, Kafka, and Sebald; and film by Haneke, Kubrick, Ophuls, and Hitchcock.

With a view to probing an inter- and intra-relationship between censorship practices among a variety of imperial/colonial regions, this course studies the institutions related to censorship, the human agents involved in censorship—both external and internal—and texts and translations that were produced in and outside of Korea, and were subject to censorship.

The course objective is to show that while colonialism was brutal and oppressive, it was by no means a unidirectional process of domination in which Europeans plundered the African continent and enforced a wholesale adoption of European culture. Rather, scholars today recognize that colonial encounters were complex culture, political, and economic fields of interaction. Africans actively adopted, reworked, and contested colonizers' policies and projects, and Europeans drew heavily from these encounters to form liberal conceptions of self, nation, and society. Over the course of the quarter, students will learn about forms of personhood, political economy, and everyday life in the twentieth century. Course themes will include social reproduction, kinship practices, medicine, domesticity, and development.

Since the late 1990s, a reassessment of the legacy of the NLAC has been taking shape as scholars have begun to interrogate its canonical status in the face of a changed political climate. In the sphere of filmmaking, contemporary Latin American new wave cinemas are also grappling with that legacy-sometimes disavowing it, sometimes appropriating it.

Freud and his disciple Otto Rank before 1920 related the uncanny to the cinema, and cinema’s ability to evoke the uncanny has been frequently observed. On the one hand, the cinema’s ability to portray uncanny events (as in Rank and Freud’s invocation of the 1913 film the Student in Prague) appears generically in films of fantasy or horror. In addition, some theorists have felt that film as a medium could be best approached via the uncanny. In this class, we will read a series of the key texts and try to survey the terrain of the concept of the uncanny.

We will apply the concepts and techniques of corporate finance to actual situations. The course is roughly divided into three sections: (1) financing decisions; (2) investment decisions; (3) entrepreneurial finance; and (4) private equity finance. In addition to analyzing the specific financing problems or issues, we will consider how those issues relate to the strategic objectives of the firm. It will be important to examine the \"big picture\" assumptions that are used in the numerical calculations. This course also places a strong emphasis on presentation and discussion skills. It will be important to explain your positions or arguments to each other and to try to argue for the implementation of your recommendations. COURSE PROCEDURES For each class meeting, I will assign study questions concerning one or two case studies. For most of the class period, we will consider the questions and the material in the cases. This includes the first meeting. You are allowed and encouraged, but not required to meet in groups outside of class to discuss and analyze the cases. Each group will submit a two-page memorandum of analysis and recommendations at the beginning of each case discussion. If you are working in a group, I will accept one memorandum from the group and count it for all students in the group. If you choose to do this, the group can include up to 3 students. Each memorandum should be typed and double-spaced. Write these as if you were writing a recommendation to the CEO or major decision maker in the case. The two page limit is for text only. You may attach as many numerical calculations as you wish. Memoranda will not be accepted after the class has met. A memorandum will be given credit if it is handed in and no credit if it is not. Initially, therefore, I will not grade them. However, I will use the memoranda to determine final grades for those students who are on the border of two grades. You should prepare a memorandum for UST, the first class. The readings and articles that I have assigned and will hand out are largely non-technical in nature and summarize the findings of academic research in corporate finance in the recent past. These articles are meant to be background material that will help you analyze the cases. They should not necessarily be cited in the case discussion. You should argue as if you were in a corporate boardroom rather than in a doctoral seminar. The process of arriving at the answer is as important as getting the answer. Because of the nature of this course (and its grading criteria), it is extremely important that you attend every class, arrive on time and be prepared to participate. To help me out, you should bring your name cards to each class. I may not remember who said what without those cards. In the past, students have asked me to hand out my case analysis after the class has discussed the case. I will not do this, because there are usually no absolute right answers. The best cases are deliberately written to be ambiguous. While there are no right answers, there are good arguments and bad arguments. This course is designed to help you learn to distinguish between sensible and senseless arguments. Handing out my analyses would reduce the ambiguity in the cases and partially defeat the purpose of doing cases. If you are uncomfortable with ambiguity, this class may not be for you.

The course will focus on three interrelated themes. (1) What are play and games? Drawing on thinkers like Johan Huizinga, Roger Caillois, and Bernard Suits, we will develop a vocabulary that allows us to tackle this question analytically, and to draw salient distinctions between kinds of play and games. We will also ask why humans and other animals play, and what form the answer to that question should take. (2) What is the value of playing? Sen and Nussbaum classify play as one of the basic human capabilities. Suits argues that playing games is central to the ideal human life. In investigating the significance of play to human life, we will also consider the ethics and aesthetics of playing. (3) How can thinking about play cast light on other human activities? Wittgenstein famously talks about linguistic activity in terms of games. Rawls uses games to think more generally about rule-governed institutions.

In that time, there was hardly an aspect of life that was not profoundly influenced by social class. In the ensuing period, the effects of social class have receded greatly, and perhaps have even vanished. In their place formal schooling has become the great generalized influence over who gets access to the desiderata of social life, including food, shelter, political power, and medical care.

In doing so, clients fundamentally shift from having their lives about their past and their problems to a life about their values and their future. This class is intended to provide students with a comprehensive overview of and practice with the principles of ACT. To that end, via lecture, experiential exercises, role-play and a self-change project, participants will be presented with the underlying theory (Relation Frame Theory) and assumptions of ACT, an ACT conceptualization of human suffering, a model of psychological rigidity and flexibility and the six basic clinical processes.

This course will examine this three-hundred-year history by investigating the following essential questions: (1) How did a collection of diverse kingdoms manage to create a global empire? (2) What specific factors can explain the Spanish decline of the seventeenth century? (3) Was the Spanish Empire doomed to fail from the very beginning? (4) Why did many colonial subjects remain loyal to Spain after the Conquest and especially after a century of decline? (5) Why did the empire collapse only after 1808? In our exploration of these questions, we will pay particular attention to Spain's ambitious and pioneering, if also destructive, involvement with conquest, colonial exploitation, chattel slavery, racial domination, and a mission to \"civilize\" the world. We will then proceed to investigate the Spanish decline of the seventeenth century and the influence of the emerging empires of Britain, France, and the Dutch Republic.

With a view to probing an inter- and intra-relationship between censorship practices among a variety of imperial/colonial regions, this course studies the institutions related to censorship, the human agents involved in censorship—both external and internal—and texts and translations that were produced in and outside of Korea, and were subject to censorship.

Among the most exciting and novel findings and theories, evolutionary biologists and comparative psychologists have shown that moral cognition has evolved to facilitate cooperation and smooth social interactions, and that certain components of morality are present in non-human animals. Developmental psychologists came up with ingenious paradigms, demonstrating that the elements that underpin morality are in place much earlier than we thought, and clearly in place before children turn two. Social neuroscientists have begun to map brain circuits implicated in moral decision-making and identify the contribution of neuropetides to moral sensitivity. Changes in the balance of brain chemistry, or in connectivity between regions can cause changes in moral behavior. The lesson from all this new knowledge is clear: human moral behavior cannot be separated from human biology, its development, and past evolutionary history. As our understanding of the human brain improves, society at large, and justice and the law in particular, are and will be increasingly challenged. Discoveries in neuroscience will soon impact our legal system in ways that hopefully lead to a more cost-effective, humane and flexible system than we have today.

The tools of engineering are important in making and translating basic discoveries in other fields into new intellectual opportunities and, sometimes, useful technologies. Institute for Molecular Engineering The Institute for Molecular Engineering (IME) is founded on the principle of collaborative problem-solving, not rigid academic disciplines. It is at the forefront of an emerging field that has the potential to address fundamental problems of societal import. This exciting new field involves the incorporation of synthetic molecular building blocks into functional systems that will impact technologies from advanced medical therapies to quantum computing. Created in partnership with Argonne National Laboratory, the IME builds on the tradition of collaboration and cutting-edge research well established at Argonne and the University of Chicago. It conducts research at the intersection of chemical, electrical, mechanical, and biological engineering, as well as materials, biological, and physical sciences. The institute’s exploration of innovative technologies in nanoscale manipulation and design at a molecular scale has the potential for impact in such areas as energy, health care, and the environment. Major Program in Molecular Engineering The BS degree program in Molecular Engineering offers undergraduates a cutting-edge engineering curriculum built on a strong foundation in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology. Courses are designed to develop quantitative reasoning and problem-solving skills; to introduce engineering analysis of physical, chemical, and biological systems; and to address open-ended technological questions across a spectrum of disciplines. The program will both prepare undergraduates for a wide variety of careers in technology-focused industries and position graduates for further postgraduate study in such fields as science, engineering, medicine, business, or law. The aim is to introduce invention and design, along with inquiry and discovery, as fruitful and complementary intellectual activities. Majors are able to choose from two quantitative engineering analysis tracks, one aimed at engineering with a biological, chemical, and soft materials emphasis, and one geared toward applied physics. The applied physics track, offered in close collaboration with the Department of Physics, is one of the first initiatives worldwide to formally educate quantum engineers at the undergraduate level. MENG 29500 Engineering Design is a 300-unit design course offered as a capstone, in which student teams spend an intensive quarter working with a faculty mentor to solve an open-ended problem, for example, analyzing chemical and biological properties of cancer cells to develop new treatment and delivery vehicles or harnessing the properties of electrons in materials to develop quantum information technologies. The course also combines technical skills with an exploration of economics, regulatory and legal issues, and ethics. Major Program Requirements 1. A strong and broad background in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology. It is imperative for a modern engineer to have a strong and broad background in the sciences. Traditional engineering disciplines have had requirements in math, chemistry, and physics for decades and many programs have evolved to require biology as well. The highly interdisciplinary nature of Molecular Engineering requires a foundation built across the mathematical, physical, and biological sciences. Students are encouraged to complete their general education requirements at the highest level for which they are prepared. This will position them better to take advantage of advanced electives and research opportunities. As discussed in more detail below, there will be two tracks for Molecular Engineering majors, one aimed towards engineering with a biological, chemical, and soft materials emphasis, and one aimed towards applied physics. Students in the former track will follow precedent set by Chemistry and Biological Sciences majors in that they will likely take chemistry in year 1, physics in year 2, and follow the recommended mathematics courses in the Chemistry curriculum. Students in the latter track will follow precedent set by Physics majors in that they will likely take physics in year 1, follow the mathematics guidelines of Physics majors, and take chemistry in year 2. 2. MENG 26030 Introduction to Engineering Analysis. One of the first courses for all Molecular Engineering majors, this course teaches students to apply mathematical methods towards solving problems that cut across multiple engineering sub-disciplines. A major objective of the course is to teach simple programming skills and computational methods in applied mathematics, including the use of engineering software such as Matlab, Mathematica, Comsol, and elements of Python. The skills that are introduced here will be further developed and strengthened throughout the rest of the curriculum. 3. Two quantitative engineering analysis tracks: Biological, Chemical, and Soft Materials Engineering and Quantum Engineering. Reflecting the research and education themes of the IME, two highly intertwined but recognizably different tracks for the major are available to students. One is aimed at preparing students oriented towards biological, chemical, and soft materials engineering, and the other is aimed at preparing students oriented towards engineering of quantum-based materials, devices, and processes. The latter track is offered in close collaboration with the Department of Physics. The main difference in the tracks relates to a choice between two sequences of three courses under the heading of quantitative engineering analysis. 4. MENG 29500 Engineering Design (300-unit capstone course). This “immersion” design course teaches students how to bring combinations of fundamental science and engineering together to solve open-ended and challenging engineering problems. It also serves as a vehicle to teach other equally important non-technical skills, including: • Problem identification: technology analysis, competitive analysis, market analysis, stakeholder analysis, product definition • Impact of the project, including sociological and engineering ethics • Project planning • Project economics: costs, value/investment analysis, risk analysis and adjustment • Prototyping, experimental design, data analysis, error analysis • IP: patenting, prior art, patentability • Legal and regulatory analysis • Proposing, presenting and reporting • Teamwork IME faculty and fellows will propose open-ended projects for which they will serve as mentors. Students will work together in groups of three. 5. Materials and advanced electives (3 required courses in the major). The major is offered in such a way as to allow for considerable flexibility for students to tailor their programs along individualized trajectories, with help from faculty advisors. Not only can students choose between two tracks, but they can further build breadth or depth through their choice of a materials course and advanced electives. Moreover, we anticipate that our students will use their general electives outside of the major requirements to strengthen their backgrounds in specific areas of interest, also in consultation with Molecular Engineering advisors, to achieve desired outcomes such as preparation for graduate school in more traditional engineering disciplines. 6. Laboratory skills and hands-on experience. Critical skills that molecular engineers must acquire as part of their educational program include the ability to apply knowledge of mathematics, science, and engineering and the ability to design and conduct experiments, as well as the ability to analyze and interpret data. Molecular Engineering majors develop these skills through lab components associated with required courses in the physical and biological sciences, Molecular Engineering courses including MENG 26101-26102 Transport Phenomena I: Forces + Flows; Transport Phenomena II, MENG 26201-26202 Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics I-II, MENG 29500 Engineering Design, and some of the advanced electives such as MENG 27300 Polymer Physics and Engineering. We also anticipate that many Molecular Engineering students will receive advanced laboratory experience pursuing undergraduate research projects. 7. Non-technical skills. Many decades of workshops and panels engaging stakeholders in academia and industry, often associated with the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET), have identified criteria for outcomes of students in accredited engineering education programs. Although there is no thought of seeking ABET accreditation for the Molecular Engineering major, many ABET criteria, particularly those related to non-technological skills, are viewed as essential to incorporate into the Molecular Engineering major. Examples of student outcomes that fall into this category include: (a) an ability to formulate or design a system, process, or program to meet desired needs, (b) an ability to function on multidisciplinary teams, (c) an understanding of professional and ethical responsibility, (d) an ability to communicate effectively, (e) the broad education necessary to understand the impact of solutions in a global and societal context, (f) a recognition of the need for and an ability to engage in life-long learning, and (g) a knowledge of contemporary issues. Many of these outcomes will be addressed through both the Molecular Engineering degree curriculum (emphasized in the design sequence and the research colloquium) and the College general education requirements. Students who are able to both develop and articulate these skills will be positioned favorably for employment in industry and for postgraduate study (engineering, medicine, law, and business administration). Entering the Program Students must indicate their intent to pursue the BS program at the end of the Autumn Quarter in their second year of study by completing the Intent to Pursue Molecular Engineering questionnaire (available on the IME website). They begin the engineering curriculum in the following Spring Quarter with enrollment in either MENG 26010 Engineering Principles of Conservation or MENG 26020 Engineering Electrodynamics. Both courses require the completion of their stated prerequisites. Students should work with their advisers early in their first year of study to plan for those prerequisites to be completed in a timely manner.

The overall objective of the program is to provide basic engineering tools and ways of thinking to students that augment scientific approaches and problem solving skills. Minor Program Requirements Before a student can declare the minor in molecular engineering, the student must: Complete the general education requirements in mathematics and physical or biological sciences Earn a B or higher in MENG 20000 Introduction to Emerging Technologies Following completion of the general education requirements and MENG 20000 Introduction to Emerging Technologies (with a grade of B or better), students may apply to the director of undergraduate studies of the Institute for Molecular Engineering for admission into the minor in molecular engineering program. A student must receive the director of undergraduate studies’ approval of the minor program on a form obtained from the student's College adviser. Once signed by the director, this form must then be returned to the student's College adviser by the end of Spring Quarter of the student's third year. To earn the minor in molecular engineering, a student must complete five molecular engineering courses chosen in consultation with the director of undergraduate studies. Before meeting with the director, students should invest some thought into which courses they would like to complete for the minor and how those courses relate as a set. MENG 20000 Introduction to Emerging Technologies and MENG 29700 Undergraduate Research for Molecular Engineering must be among the five courses counted toward the minor. In rare cases, courses offered by other departments and programs may be approved by the director of undergraduate studies as substitutes for courses listed above. Courses in the minor program may not be (1) double counted with the student's major(s) or with other minors, or (2) counted toward general education requirements. Courses in the minor must be taken for quality grades, and more than half of the requirements for the minor must be met by registering for courses bearing University of Chicago course numbers.

Students majoring in Molecular Engineering must receive quality grades in all courses required in the degree program. All courses in the minor must be taken for quality grades. Nonmajors and nonminors may take Molecular Engineering courses on a P/F basis; only grades of C- or higher constitute passing work. Honors Students who pursue a substantive research project with a faculty member of the Institute for Molecular Engineering are encouraged to write and defend an honors thesis based on their work. Students who wish to be considered for honors are expected to complete their arrangements with the director of undergraduate studies before the end of their third year and to register for one quarter of MENG 29700 Undergraduate Research for Molecular Engineering during their third or fourth years. To be eligible to receive honors, students in the BS degree program must write a creditable honors paper describing their research. The paper must be submitted before the deadline established by the director of undergraduate studies and must be approved by the department chairperson. In addition, an oral presentation of the research is required. The research paper or project used to meet this requirement may not be used to meet the BA/BS paper or project requirement in another major. To earn a BS degree with honors in Molecular Engineering, students must also have an overall GPA of 3.0 or higher. Molecular Engineering Courses MENG 20000.

Due to its success treating various psychiatric populations, DBT is now considered effective with persons who engage in any behavior where the function of the behavior is to avoid or escape aversive thoughts and/or emotions. DBT was one of the first cognitive behavior therapies to integrate mindfulness, acceptance and willingness into treatment regimens that traditionally focus on change and control. It is therefore considered a pioneering therapy in what is now called the \"third wave\" in behaviorism. This class is intended to provide students with advanced training in the principles and practice of DBT. To that end, via lecture, experiential exercises, roleplay and a self-change project, participants will be exposed to the four components of DBT: Skills Training, Individual Therapy, Telephone Consultation and the Consultation Group. However, a basic tenet of DBT is that therapists should not expect their clients to engage in behaviors and activities they are unwilling to do. Therefore, emphasis in this class will be place on experiential knowledge. Therefore, interested participants will be expected to make a basic set of commitments that expose them to many of the emotional reactions experienced by their future clients. In addition to a self-change project, participants will commit to complete a diary card and practice mindfulness on a daily basis.

This, in many ways, reflects the narrative eighteenth-century writers were developing about their own age. For British Whigs, the “Glorious Revolution” of 1688 had been a watershed moment at which the arbitrary rule of kings had been replaced for all time by constitutionalism; the social contract and the civil polity had triumphed over divine-right ideology, ushering in a new, beneficent era of progress. And, in the 1790s, the French Revolution fired the political imaginations of British radicals who saw the potential for a world made anew – a world of universal suffrage and gender equality, where slavery was abolished. Clearly, attaining these goals was a long way off. The debates over the structures, meanings, and nature of consent had tendrils in multiple areas of society – the law, of course, but also in understandings of sexuality, constructions of gender, economics, and colonization. Questions of rights, agency, and authority (what those categories meant, who could possess them, and who guaranteed them) were by no means settled, and, indeed, throughout the century, calls to curtail the categories of people who should have access to the sphere of political influence were often as boisterous as those to expand such access. This course will explore how a range of authors in eighteenth-century Britain figured questions of consent, rights, and authority and how the ideological debates these authors mediated continue to inform contemporary politics, cultures, and identities. We will read works by literary figures such as Daniel Defoe, Samuel Richardson, Mary Hays, Olaudah Equiano, and Mary Shelley. We will consider the writings of some of the major political philosophers of the day, as well, including John Locke, Thomas Hobbes, Mary Astell, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Thomas Paine, and Mary Wollstonecraft.

Developments in Islamic thought will be considered in the context of global trends, from the rise of liberalism, nationalism, and socialism to the liberation movements of the twentieth century and the confusion sewn by humanitarian crises of an unprecedented scale. Amidst these dramatic shifts in the geopolitical landscape, how have Muslim thinkers sought to ground their demands for dignity, autonomy, justice, and recognition? What do such claims have to do with the pursuit of personal and collective piety, on the one hand, and spiritual transcendence, on the other? Rather than framing Muslim political thinkers as reacting to global modernity, we understand them as key actors in shaping it, and our study of their writings will be oriented toward achieving a better understanding of the modern era as a whole. Our primary readings will take us from Istanbul, London, and the Nile Delta to Chicago, Tehran, and beyond, while our secondary texts will offer historical background and theoretical and theological context for the thinkers we focus on.

The seminar brings both historical and international perspectives to bear, taking up selected examples that highlight how political responses to poverty and inequality vary over time and in different national settings. It also draws attention to the strategic implications for policymaking and practice.", "sectionid": "[42734]", "section": "1", "location": "TBA", "coursenumber": "HMRT30401", "career": "Graduate", "instructor": "Evelyn Brodkin", "condition": "Closed", "daytime": "Wed : 12:00 PM-02:50 PM"}, "EALC398001[53649]": {"subsections": [], "name": "History of Ancient China", "type": "LEC", "description": "This course will survey the history of China from the late Shang dynasty (c. 1200 B.C.) through the end of the Qin dynasty (207 B.C.).

As a matter of fact, scholars of Antiquity usually refer to Armenia only when it was involved into one of the frequent military crises between East and West. The country had an important strategic position, a vast expanse of territory, and wealthy natural resources. This explains very well the efforts of the Seleucids and of Rome, and of the Iranian dynasties of the Parthians and the Sassanids, to establish a military control and cultural influence over Armenia. Both contacts with the West and the East shaped the complex identity of Armenia - a somewhat mixed identity which is rather difficult to study. Therefore, both Classical and Iranian scholars tend to neglect the role of Armenia, or to diminish its position in the balance of power: the anachronistic cliché of a Greater Armenia as a «buffer state» is still mentioned. Accordingly, the few specialists on pre-Christian Armenia hardly communicate with those other scholars. Therefore, the very marginality of the kingdom of Armenia has not stimulated neither Classical scholars, nor Iranian scholars, to show interest in Armenia as well. This course will present a comprehensive history of ancient Armenia, from its origins to the fall of the kingdom in 428 CE, in order to reconstruct the history of the Artaxiad and of the Arsacid dynasties within a geopolitical frame considering the role of Armenia between Rome and Iran.”", "sectionid": "[43168]", "section": "1", "location": "TBA", "coursenumber": "NEHC30155", "career": "Graduate", "instructor": "Giusto Traina", "condition": "Open", "daytime": "Tue Thu : 10:30 AM-11:50 AM"}, "DVSC499007[57307]": {"subsections": [], "name": "Exam Preparation: Divinity", "type": "IND", "description": "Open only to Ph.D. students in quarter of qualifying exams.
